In fact, taking scissors to dry hair has never been more popular. That's because for certain hair types and styles, getting snipped when your hair is completely dry can actually improve the results—as well as improve the condition of your hair too. The following six reasons just might turn you into a dry cut convert too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>1) Dry cutting is a friend to people with curly and wavy hair.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anyone with temperamental ringlets or waves knows that exactly where you slice and dice can make a big difference in whether you like the end result – and it can be harder to tell where the curls are going to lie when your hair is soaking wet, says renowned stylist and salon owner Paul Labrecque. Cutting while the curls are doing their thing means your stylist can pick and choose where to cut so that they lie atop one another just right.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>2) It can get you in and out of the salon faster.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ever notice how, after you have a traditional, wet hair cut and your stylist has dried your hair she often has to go back over it again with the scissors, trimming here and there? Doing it dry to begin with eliminates most of this second-round work, says stylist Vanessa Ungaro, co-owner of the salon Lauren + Vanessa in New York City, where Ungaro exclusively uses the dry cutting method.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>3) It can be gentler on fragile, thinning hair.&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wet hair is more fragile and elastic (especially if over processed or fine), and can be prone to snapping while it's being combed over and over during a wet cut, says Ungaro. You're likely to shed fewer strands during the whole process if you have a dry cut, notes Labrecque, which is important for people with thinning hair or who are concerned about breakage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>4) There may be fewer surprises.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because hair is so stretchy when wet, it looks much longer, and this is especially true for people with very curly hair, says Labrecque. Cutting the hair when it's already dry allows the stylist to trim just the right amount off – and eliminates the shock factor that can come right after a cut, when it can bounce up way more than anyone expected. What you see is what you get when you cut it dry, and that can cut down on any miscommunication between client and stylist, says Ungaro.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>5) It can be more precise.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you dry cut you really get to see the movement of the hair, where most of the weight is and how much really needs to be cut off, says Ungaro, making it an ideal choice for fine or thin hair as well. &nbsp;One more bonus: You can see split ends more clearly when the hair is dry!&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>6) It's 100% tailored to you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When hair is cut wet, many stylists are just following a formula and doing the movements that they were taught in school, says Ungaro. "But when you cut dry, you are creating a completely individual, custom haircut especially for the client sitting in your chair," says Ungaro. "I cut by eye and create movement within the hair so no matter which way the wind moves it your hair will look amazing and fall into place."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGZmad8on2Sb2ltZ5Snxm60wKKpZpulqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wole-soyinka-s-children-and-wives.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wole Soyinkas children and wives</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whitneybae-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whitneybae Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
