The case was resolved in arbitration, according to court documents filed last week (<a href=#>and first reported by TorrentFreak</a>). The matter went to arbitration after lots of back and forth between the two parties — including a counterclaim that Bungie <a href=#>hacked one of AimJunkies’ developers</a>.</p><p id=KLRsKk>Since 2021, Bungie has <a href=#>gone after cheat makers in court</a>, alleging copyright infringement of their products, and AimJunkies is <a href=#>one of the hack creators</a> <a href=#>the company has targeted</a>. AimJunkies, owned by Phoenix Digital Group, makes aimbots, wall hacks, and other cheats for Destiny 2 and several other popular games. AimJunkies’ online marketplace is still up, but its Destiny 2 cheats are no longer on the menu, apparently due to an injunction from the arbitration filing.</p><p id=SYfPkm>The case arbitrator found that AimJunkies violated the <a href=#>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> by using tools to reverse engineer Destiny 2 in order to make their cheats. Bungie also banned an AimJunkies developer “several times,” according to the documents, who then circumvented protections to regain access to the game. Bungie was awarded $2,500 for 102 violations in all, costing AimJunkies $255,000. The company was also fined $3.4 million for selling its Destiny 2 cheats; Bungie said AimJunkies sold more than 1,000 cheats, each of which the company was fined for.</p><p id=Lr2fQb>Bungie also convinced the arbitrator of other claims against AimJunkies, like breach of contract — specifically the terms and conditions signed to play Destiny 2 — as well as interfering with Bungie’s user contracts with its players; violating the Consumer Protection Act; and destroying evidence. The total judgment amounts to more than $3.6 million in damages, plus legal costs, bringing the winnings up to $4.3 million.</p><p id=XrXWD0>“We’re pleased to have been awarded what we believe to be the first instance of statutory damages for a DMCA violation,” Bungie general counsel Don McGowan said in a statement issued to Polygon. “We’ve made our position against cheaters and illegal cheat makers abundantly clear in publicly-accessible court filings and our in-game actions. We will continue to take action against bad actors who damage the player experience for the rest of the community.”</p><p id=r7QpJ8>AimJunkies has not responded to Polygon’s request for comment.</p><p id=5Ncy4d>It’s another big win in Bungie’s battle against cheat makers, who continue to do <a href=#>a lot of business</a> around the world. In April 2021, Bungie and Valorant creator Riot Games teamed up to sue GatorCheats, another hack creator. <a href=#>The case was settled</a>, with GatorCheats agreeing to pay $2 million in damages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57kWxtaXFiZYNwsMSsq6KmqWJ%2Fbq7Up56inV2Wtq621Keiop2jYrCpscCtZKaZm5q%2FbrjAsKquoaQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./donis-leonard-jr-house-of-lies-cast-member.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Donis Leonard Jr. - House of Lies Cast Member</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breath-of-the-wild-dragon-locations-for-naydra-dinraal-and-farosh.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Breath of the Wild dragon locations for Naydra, Dinraal and Farosh</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
