For those of you who may not know, Chris Brown and Quavo have been going back and forth with diss tracks. However, an update from this weekend has fans theorizing that Brown might be on some truly diabolical work right now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At a recent Quavo concert, it appeared as though the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">crowd might as well have been empty</a>. This subsequently led to people believing that Chris Brown had bought out the tickets so that no one could actually attend. From there, people would see the images of Quavo's concert, and assume that he had fallen off. It is a pretty interesting move, that does nothing but put money in Quavo's pockets. Consequently, not everyone is convinced that this is what is happening. However, Fif couldn't help but give his take on all of this.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-speaks>50 Cent Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Oh this shit getting different," 50 said. Overall, the legendary artist seems to be very amused by all of this, and it is easy to see why. After all, this is a very unique situation, especially as Chris Brown and Quavo continue to throw diss tracks at one another. At this point, there is no telling how this is all going to finish. If anything is for certain, it's that reconciliation won't be in the cards for at least a little while.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this entire situation, in the comments section down below.
