If you're a fan of country music, then you likely know that he's a successful singer. You might also know that he's faced controversy and even found himself <a href=#>apologizing to fans</a>. Beyond that, do you think you'd be able to fill others in on the meanings behind some of his popular songs? For instance, there's <a href=#>"Does To Me"</a> and <a href=#>"Even Though I'm Leaving"</a> as well as <a href=#>"Better Together"</a> and <a href=#>"Behind Forever After All."</a> Of course, there's also <a href=#>"Lovin' On You."</a></p><p dir=ltr>"I like a bobber on the water / Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in / I like a Friday night slow ride / Brooks & Dunn B-side / ... I like a strong shot of whiskey / The way a Marlboro hits me / Some broken-in cowboy boots," Combs sings in the first verse in the song from his 2019 "What You See Is What You Get" album, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Genius</a>. In the second verse, he adds, "I like a sunrise, duck blind / Birdie on a par 5 / Miller Lite before noon / I like a two-door old Ford / Wood board back porch / Three chords and the truth."</p><p dir=ltr>What do all of those things have in common? Well, they're clearly a list of the things and experiences that Combs enjoys. However, even these things can't seem to compare to something else that he loves. Read on to find out what — or rather, who — that might be and how he really feels about them!</p><h2>Is 'Lovin' On You' about Luke Combs' wife, Nicole Hocking?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-meaning-behind-luke-combs-lovin-on-you/is-lovin-on-you-about-luke-combs-wife-nicole-hocking-1622739882.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p dir=ltr>Listening to <a href=#>"Lovin' On You"</a> from Luke Combs certainly makes what the star appreciates obvious. However, even though he mentions plenty of things he likes, he only sings about one thing that he loves.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"But I'm in love and lovin' on you / I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room / I can't get enough of you, honey / You're right on the money," Combs sings in the chorus of the song written by himself along with James McNair, Ray Fulcher, and Thomas Archer, according to <a href=#>Genius</a>. He also repeats, "I'm in love and lovin' on you."</p><p>While Combs is obviously singing about a certain someone that he seems to love (and loves "lovin' on"), he doesn't exactly name who that is. Of course, we're going to go ahead and assume that it's <a href=#>his wife, Nicole Hocking</a>. We know that he wrote his 2017 song "Beautiful Crazy" for Hocking (despite the fact that they weren't even dating yet), so it wouldn't be the first time he showed a little love for the lady in his life through his music. Telling <a href=#>The Artist and The Athlete</a> podcast that "Beautiful Crazy" was the song that was played during the first dance at the <a href=#>couple's wedding in 2020</a>, he explained, "There's no way that any other song will top that as far as sentimental value for me." Granted, we're sure that "Lovin' On You" is still pretty darn special.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpnbX91e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqSloLJur86mmaxlnKTDqrqMqKVmsZ%2BqfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyrese-gibson-wife-samantha-lee-welcome-newborn-daughter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyrese Gibson &amp;amp; Wife Samantha Lee Welcome Newborn Daughter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ted-black-ink-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ted Black Ink Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
