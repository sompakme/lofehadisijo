Of course, the main thing that people wanted to hear was the music, and Ye and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ty Dolla $ign</a> previewed a lot of tracks from their collab series' second installment. Some were previously played tracks like "RIVER" that really caught fans' ears during the past listening parties across the U.S. and Europe. Others were brand-new or even older leaks that will apparently be part of this new album cycle. However, one of the most notable things to actually happen during the event was seeing the Chicago artist and his wife Bianca Censori just have fun together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moreover, the two laughed and smiled at each other as Ye played one of their tracks, seemingly also featuring <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>. At one point, he pulled her body closer to his in a pretty suggestive way, and it seems like they had a great time overall. This listening party was certainly a very different experience to that of previous iterations, as it felt more like a traditional DJ set than a pseudo-performance on a stage. For those who have only seen Bianca Censori and her husband through <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">wild fit pics</a> and paparazzi antics, it's nice to just see them live in the moment.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bianca-censori-joins-ye-at-vultures-listening-event-watch>Bianca Censori Joins Ye At Vultures Listening Event: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, with Ye recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">posting the VULTURES 2 album cover itself</a>, which is apparently of either him or Ty Dolla Sign holding a picture of his incarcerated brother who was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he says he didn't commit, some fans hope that they'll be quick to drop part two. But we all know it's never been that simple. Still, there are a lot more listening parties to come in the next few days. We're sure that Bianca Censori will be there to support all of them.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But do you think that VULTURES 2 actually drops this weekend or are we getting it a weekend or two down the road... or not at all? What about <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the alleged tension</a> when it comes to Bianca's family's view of the relationship?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbIBxgpFmopqmqZp6uLHSrWSvrZypwrOx0mZpZpqZlrukrYycnKern6e2brjIrKueppmjtG68wKursmWYnr1utM6pZKedp6g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leonard-bernstein-s-net-worth-adjusted-to-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leonard Bernsteins Net Worth [Adjusted to 2024]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-room-do-you-need-for-a-circle-driveway.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much room do you need for a circle driveway?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
