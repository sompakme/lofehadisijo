But you shouldn't let this make you feel less than yourself. Always respect other people's opinions and learn to walk away. If you are constantly asking yourself things like "I can't get over her and why", below are 11 simple ways how to get over a girl who friend-zoned you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/af8c428783f29565.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to tell him I like him: surefire ways to confess your feelings</span></p></a><h2>How to get over a girl you like or love</h2><p class=align-left>It can be amazing to <a href=#>fall in love.</a> Whatever the cause, if you have fallen in love with a girl who doesn't feel the same, you must get past these emotions in order to move on with your life. Here are some ways to help you overcome it.</p><h3>1. Accept it</h3><p class=align-left>The hardest thing in life is to accept that the girl of your dreams doesn't <a href=#>love you</a>. You have to realise that someone isn't right for you at some time. Not thinking about her does not imply acceptance of the situation as it is.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, it implies that you are happy to let her go and move on. You can <a href=#>express your feelings</a> about her rejection in writing if it helps. It may sound corny, but accepting it is the best way of how to let go of a crush.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><h3>2. Acknowledge your feelings</h3><p class=align-left>It is natural and normal to feel grief before accepting that you are crushing on someone who feels nothing for you. You will feel mad and rejected, but you have to accept and move on. Admit to yourself that you are going through a difficult time, and it is okay to feel sad or mad about it. Know you can only be friends and nothing more.</p><h3>3. Don't blame yourself</h3><p class=align-left>Most people start blaming themselves if a girl doesn't love them back. Guys are often victims of self-blame when a girl they like doesn't seem to reciprocate their feelings. One way how to get over a girl who doesn't like you is to quit blaming yourself or thinking there is something wrong with you.</p><p class=align-left>Quit asking yourself what you are not doing or looking for answers from her. Sometimes you even feel like you want to apologise to her again to see if she will change her mind. Don't jump down that rabbit hole and obsess over why she doesn't want you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5e633f5e8bc00a7b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>80+ romantic crush quotes to help you express your secret love</span></p></a><h3>4. Seek professional help</h3><p class=align-left>A heartbreak can leave you devastated beyond what you can handle. If you want to know how to get over a girlfriend you still love, seek professional help. You can visit a therapist, specifically someone specialising in relationships or join a support group.</p><p class=align-left>This is an option if you are having difficulty getting over your ex. A therapist will help validate your feelings and empathise with your emotions. In addition, just sharing your story can help build you up.</p><h3>5. Be in control of your emotions</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/af8c428783f29565.jpg><p class=align-left>When you face rejection from a girl you like, you may feel great anger and resentment. This is especially if you were so invested and she rejected you for no reason. At first, it may seem normal to be angry, but if it lasts too long, it becomes unhealthy for you.</p><p class=align-left>These negative feelings will take a toll on your emotional and physical health. It would help if you recognised this behaviour as unhealthy; this is the first step in letting go. In learning to let go, you can also learn to control your emotions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b3140eb2785e55bd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Incredible ideas on how to tell someone you like them</span></p></a><h3>6. Keep your distance</h3><p class=align-left>Nothing hurts like constant reminders of the <a href=#>girl you love</a>, especially when it's clear she doesn't love you more than a friend. The best way how to get over a crush you see every day is to keep your distance.</p><p class=align-left>It helps soothe the pain of rejection by simply cutting off all communication. Don't allow yourself to be <a href=#>friend zoned</a>, especially if you have romantic feelings for her. A good rule of thumb is to scale back your interaction with her; as the saying goes, out of sight, out of mind.</p><h3>7. Take care of yourself</h3><p class=align-left>A heartbreak or rejection can hurt, and sometimes people tend to neglect themselves. You don't want to do anything as you feel hopeless. It is hard to take care of yourself when you have emotional pain since it affects your self-esteem.</p><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to lose feelings for a girl, then let go of the feelings and take good care of yourself. Self-care during a breakup or rejection is not easy, but it's possible. You can go for a walk and exercise, which will help you boost your mood and reduces anxious feelings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5e08599a25d4ba3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I don't know what I want to do with my life - 10 tips to help you through this</span></p></a><h3>8.

You will be tempted to stalk your crush on social media to see what she is up to.</p><p class=align-left>Do not allow yourself to go down this road.
