The episode, which aired on June 14, is being scrutinized not only because of Barr’s antisemitic comments, but also because Theo Von didn’t question or condemn her theories while she was laying out her case. In addition to her Holocaust denial, Barr went on to say that she was fired from “Jewish Hollywood” despite the fact that she is Jewish herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here is the full clip of Roseanne Barr obviously using sarcasm and satire. She is a mensch and one of the funniest people i've ever met. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p0K6pWEqr8</a></p>— Theo Von (@TheoVon) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p>Theo Von replied to the Roseanne Barr backlash by posting the almost four-minute clip from the two-and-a-half-hour podcast episode. Von stated that Barr was “obviously using sarcasm and satire” to drive home a bigger point, but his defense is also being met with criticism given the context of the conversation.</p><p>Though Von and Barr were seemingly talking about the bigger picture of what free speech means in America, which is normally considered fair game, but it’s the antisemitic nature of the conversation that is being called into question by Twitter users, The American Jewish Committee, and the Anti-Defamation League.</p><p>The American Jewish committee went on record stating that whether Roseanne Barr was being serious or facetious doesn’t matter when you consider the sensitivity of the subject. Given the nature of Theo Von’s informal, casual conversation format, Barr used his platform to explain why she thinks Jewish Hollywood is run like an “organized crime network.”</p><p>Barr went on to say that although she’s of Jewish heritage, she’s “not the right kind of Jew,” which is why she was fired from Hollywood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Antisemitism isn’t a joke and the Holocaust is not a subject for sarcasm.</p><p>Regardless of intent, Roseanne Barr’s conspiracy theories fuel anti-Jewish hatred.<a href=#>@TheoVon</a>, as host, failed to condemn this dangerous and shocking rhetoric.</p>— American Jewish Committee (@AJCGlobal) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p>Jonathan Greenblatt, the director of the Anti-Defamation League, weighed in on the episode, and condemned Roseanne Barr’s comments as “reprehensible and irresponsible.” While an overwhelming amount of Twitter users are agreeing with this sentiment, and how Theo Von shouldn’t have let the conversation go as far as it did, other users are coming to Barr’s defense, stating that the interview is being taken out of context to make her look bad while condemning free speech.</p><p>There’s always a very thin line that separates intention and perception, and we’re seeing this conversation play out in real time on Twitter showing us both sides of the coin.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sarcasm or not, Roseanne Barr’s comments about Jews and the Holocaust are reprehensible and irresponsible. This isn’t funny. And shame on Theo Von for letting it go unchallenged and instead diving into conspiracy theories about Jews and Hollywood.</p>— Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p>At this point in her career, Roseanne Barr is no stranger to controversy. Shortly after Roseanne was renewed for an eleventh season in 2018 after a successful Season 10 revival, Roseanne was fired from the show after making a <a href=#>racist</a> tweet about former President Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett. Shortly after she made these comments, Roseanne was canceled, and rebranded as The Connors, allowing the rest of the cast to continue the series without her.</p><p>Moments like this illustrate the difference between intent, execution, and reception.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnoqTApq3Np5xmmpGnv260zqWmnJmlqMFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./squinching-photogenic-technique-squinching-before-after-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Squinching Photogenic Technique - Squinching Before After Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mel-fisher-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mel Fisher Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
