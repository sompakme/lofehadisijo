I'll be back."</p><p>Wuornos, 46, was convicted 10 years ago of killing six middle-aged men who she picked up while working as a prostitute along Interstate 75 in Florida. She was initially charged with the murder of Richard Mallory, the owner of an electronics store who she shot dead in 1989.</p><p>Wuornos pleaded not guilty, arguing in court that she had killed Mallory in self-defence. But after she was found guilty, she pleaded guilty to five further killings telling the state's Supreme Court: "I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again."</p><p>The life and crimes of Wuornos, the 10th woman to be executed in the United States since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976, inspired two films, a number of books and an opera, Wuornos, by composer Carla Lucero.</p><p>"On the one hand, it's a horrible story about a woman who was betrayed from infancy," said Lucero.</p><p>"But it's also one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever heard.</p><p>"Aileen loved another woman so much she sacrificed her own life.</p><p>"Of course, it's also totally dysfunctional, but most good love stories, in opera especially, are the most dysfunctional things you can imagine."</p><p>At her 1992 trial, the court was told that Wuornos, a lesbian, was repeatedly abused as a child.</p><p>Wuornos claimed she was an "exit-to-exit" highway prostitute who made US$1000 ($2090) a week having sex with 40 to 50 men.</p><p>At the time of the her arrest, she was living with her girlfriend, Tyria Moore, who testified against her.</p><p>Some of their income came from pawning goods stolen from the murdered men.</p><p>Having spent 10 years on death row, Wuornos fired her lawyers and dropped her right to appeals, actions that fuelled the debate over her sanity and competence.</p><p>Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a halt of execution and ordered a mental examination.</p><p>He lifted the stay last week after three psychiatrists who interviewed her concluded that she understood why she was being executed.</p><p>The last member of the media to interview her, British documentary maker Nick Broomfield, said he spoke to her on Tuesday.</p><p>"My conclusion from the interview is, today we are executing someone who is mad.</p><p>"Here is someone who has totally lost her mind," he said yesterday.</p><p>Wuornos' execution was witnessed by Leta Prater whose brother, Troy Burress, was among the killer's victims.</p><p>"She had death on her face," she said afterwards.</p><p>"She looked rough, but she always looked rough. I, for one, am glad she's gone."</p><p>- <a href=#>INDEPENDENT</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwssSmmKWdXaiys7XApWSkoZyhsrO%2FjJ%2Bgp5mcYsSwvsOsZKKknGKvpnnBmpqkZ2dsmZWeuW%2BLgY5%2Fa6WRpJKDeJGSY2igj4GgaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-holland-biography-who-is-tom-holland-s-younger-brother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Holland biography: who is Tom Hollands younger brother?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./earl-schuman-dead-seinfeld-actor-was-100.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Earl Schuman Dead: 'Seinfeld' Actor Was 100</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
