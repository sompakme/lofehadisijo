By the end of Season Three, it was implied that Jasper finally forgave her when he was apologetic to Monty for blaming him and Clarke and that he was done blaming.</span></span><h2>Does Raven ever forgive Clarke for killing Finn?</h2>But the treachery cost him his life. Only then, when Gustus is being sliced open again and again, does Raven realize the pain from which Clarke saved Finn. Her forgiveness comes a little quickly, but like all things during war, there's just no time to hold on, whether it's a grudge, a feeling, or a loved one's death.<h2>Who was Jasper in love with in the 100?</h2>Jasper and Maya is the relationship between Jasper Jordan and Maya Vie. They are portrayed by cast members Devon Bostick and Eve Harlow. They début in the first episode of Season Two.<h2>What happened to Jasper on the 100?</h2>The 100 is seeing some major changes for next season, as two original characters have departed from the cast – including one death in the latest episode. In 'The Other Side', Jasper – played by Devon Bostick – poisoned himself and died in a devastated Monty's (Christopher Larkin) arms.<h2>Does Echo forgive Clarke for killing Bellamy?</h2>Bellamy's betrayal ultimately leads to his death at Clarke's hands, but Echo accepts that the Bellamy she had loved was already dead and forgives Clarke, in which she blames Bill Cadogan for Bellamy's death.<h2>The 100 3x11 Clarke tries to apologies to Jasper</h2><p></p><h2>Does Echo become a Nightblood?</h2>In "Ashes to Ashes", Abby succeeds and Echo is transformed into a Nightblood by Ryker Desai. In "Adjustment Protocol", Abby, John Murphy, Emori, Sierra, Jade and Bryson become Nightbloods through Madi and Abby's bone marrow after Abby injects herself to protect Madi.<h2>Does Clarke regret killing Bellamy?</h2>Clarke apologizes for leaving Bellamy behind in Polis and mentions that it is her biggest regret. Clarke even makes a point to tell Bellamy that he is her family too, and she will not forget that again.<h2>Who does Octavia end up with in The 100?</h2>Octavia & Diyoza<p>These two meet on opposite ends of a war for the planet, but end up having to survive, just the two of them and Diyoza's daughter Hope, on a planet away from everyone else they know. During that time, they're a family.</p><h2>Who does Monty end up with in The 100?</h2>Monty and Harper said "I love you" for first time in "The Other Side", Monty was the first one to say it, then Harper said it back. However, in DNR, Monty told Harper that he loved her, but she never said it back until The Other Side. In Season Five they had a son together, Jordan Green.<h2>Why did Monty and Jasper go to jail?</h2>Jasper appears in every memory Monty has. They have been best friends since childhood. They were arrested and sent to lockup together. They were arrested for using herbs to make "stuff".<h2>Who does Bellamy end up with?</h2>One of the more funny things in the books to me is that Wells and Bellamy are half brothers. TV series: as s6e6, no they have not. Book series: yes, Clarke and Bellamy are romantic partners and are engaged.<h2>Who has Clarke slept with?</h2>Clarke kisses Niylah and they have sex. In Wanheda (Part 2), Niylah is seen being beaten and thrown around inside her trading post by Roan's partner.<h2>Why don t Bellamy and Clarke get together?</h2>In "Join or Die", Bellamy admits to Clarke that he was really angry at her for leaving and that he doesn't want to feel that way anymore. They were working together for most of Season Four, but they separated in "We Will Rise" and reunited at the end of "DNR".<h2>Does Finn love Clarke or Raven?</h2>Finn confessed his love for Clarke, but she rejected him because he broke her heart in "We Are Grounders (Part 1)". Finn confessed his love for Clarke a second time in "Spacewalker".<h2>Why do they call Clarke princess?</h2>Bellamy calls Clarke “princess” to remind the other delinquents that she's “Ark Royalty” and can't be trusted.<h2>Does Clarke become commander?</h2>Clarke Griffin was briefly implanted with the Flame to destroy A.L.I.E. , but she never took the title of Commander at least in part because she was not a Nightblood at the time and could not survive hosting the Flame permanently. She was however called "Commander" by Becca Franko when she entered the City of Light.<h2>Who are Clarks love interests in The 100?</h2>Instead, Clarke went on to find love and loss with Lexa (Alycia Debnam-Carey), and Raven … well, Raven's had her heart broken pretty constantly since Season 2.<h2>Who is Bellamy's girlfriend in season 3?</h2>Gina Martin was a minor character in the third season. She was portrayed by Leah Gibson and debuted in Wanheda (Part 1). Gina was one of the residents of Arkadia and went on supply runs to Mount Weather. Gina was Bellamy's girlfriend and brought him a present from her last supply run.<h2>What happened to Monty and Harper's son?</h2>He is now part of Clarke's group on a regenerated Earth, which is now a habitable planet again.<h2>When did Octavia get pregnant?</h2>They never had a kid Octavia was never pregnant. If you google the 100 there's a clip of her telling Lincoln she's pregnant, then they show the baby, then they leave it behind for her brother to take care of.<h2>Does Lincoln become a reaper?</h2>He later was captured by the Mountain Men, and forced to become a Reaper, but with Delinquents and Octavia's assistance, he was rescued and overcame his addiction to RED, the drug used to create the Reapers.<h2>Why did Clarke not transcend?</h2>Bellamy, for example, dies before humanity takes their final test, so, despite his belief, he doesn't transcend. Since Clarke won't transcend either, she will die a natural death. That means all of the people she knows from the Ark, the ground, and even Sanctum, who choose to transcend are essentially lost to her.<h2>Why did Bellamy betray Clarke?</h2>7 Bellamy Betrays Clarke<p>Although the show later explains that Bellamy truly believed he was doing it for the greater good or was possibly brainwashed, it is obvious that he doesn't seem very loyal when he gives out the secret that Clarke had just shared in his ears as they reunite after so long.</p><h2>Why was Bellamy ruined?</h2>Multiple deceased characters were able to transcend due to their minds still being alive, not their bodies. The explanation that Bellamy was not able to achieve transcendence makes more sense as to why he couldn't return as other deceased characters did.<h2>Does Octavia forgive Clarke?</h2>In Season Seven, after reuniting with each other on Bardo, Clarke and Octavia reconcile and apologizes to each other for their past actions. Octavia finally understands and forgives Clarke.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlmpbAsbHRZp2oqpeew6Z5wqWYq6OV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fact-check-can-carrie-underwood-play-drums.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FACT CHECK: Can Carrie Underwood Play Drums?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dmx-s-goddaughter-paige-hurd-recalls-them-getting-kicked-out-of-six-flags.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DMX's Goddaughter Paige Hurd Recalls Them Getting Kicked Out Of Six Flags</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
