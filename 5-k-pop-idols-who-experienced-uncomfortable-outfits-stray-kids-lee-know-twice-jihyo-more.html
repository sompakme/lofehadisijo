On the red carpet, REVELUVs noticed that Joy keeps on pulling her dress down and posturing awkward walking movements, which signifies that she is uncomfortable not just with her dress, but also with her thin heels.</p><p>Watch Red Velvet at the red carpet of 2019 The Fact Music Awards <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>:<br></p><p>Fans noticed the pattern of Joy's outfits, hence they have commented that even though Joy is complimented because of her figure, stylists should not take advantage of this by giving her short skirts, overly revealing clothes, and uncomfortable outfits. Because of these outfits, Joy's movements became strictly restricted.</p><h4>IN CASE YOU MISSED THIS: <a href=#>Red Velvet Joy's Real Personality Revealed by Staff Members</a></h4><p>Discussion about how some netizens sexualized Joy bottled up, thus strengthening the call to the stylists to give the 'Hello' singer comfortable and confident outfits.</p><h3><strong>2. <strong>Stray Kids Lee Know</strong></strong></h3><p>STAYs were anticipating the comeback stages of 'MANIAC' in March 2022, as the initial schedule was halted due to some members testing positive because of COVID-19. But, the fans were surprised that instead of enjoying the show, they got frustrated.</p><p>Click <a href=# rel=nofollow>HERE</a>&nbsp;to watch snippets from the fancam.</p><p>Although Stray Kids' main dancer, Lee Know, is reputable because of his intense dance and incredible stage presence, in one of his 'MANIAC' fan cams, the dancer seemed to be dancing in a less energetic way.</p><h4>READ MORE: <a href=#>Stray Kids Lee Know, TWICE Momo, EXO Kai: Here are the Top 9 Main Dancers of K-pop</a></h4><p>The fans identified that the 'MANIAC' singer kept on readjusting his shirt and belt, consequently affecting his stage performance.

TWICE Jihyo</strong></h3><h4>THIS STORY MIGHT INTEREST YOU:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 K-pop Idols Yet to Debut Solo but Can Definitely Slay as Soloists</a></h4><p>In a fan meeting, TWICE Jihyo's outfit may have magnified her commendable body figure, but the necklines of the outfit were too low, therefore causing TWICE leader to feel cautious of her movements.<br></p><p>As a response, Jihyo used her long hair and the bouquet given by fans to cover herself. Alongside Jihyo, TWICE's center, Nayeon, and one-third of the Japanese line, Mina, also experience uneasy outfits during this fan meeting.</p><h3><strong>4. ITZY Yeji</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A post shared by instagram</a></p><p>In an October event of "Charles and Keith," ITZY flexed their 'IZ MINE' collection. Here, the 'WANNABE' singers graced their formal attire, but instead of receiving applause from MIDZYs, they have shown concern about Yeji's strapless black dress that seemed to bother the group's leader.</p><h4>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=#>ITZY Breaks the Internet with THIS Photo That Screams 'Body Goals'</a></h4><p>As a response, ITZY's main vocalist came to the rescue and shielded Yeji from the cameras as she fixed her dress.</p><p>For the record, this is not Yeji's first time experiencing an awkward outfit. During a performance of 'ICY,' Yeji could not dance to her full potential since her outfit is oversized and the string at her shoulders kept on falling.</p><h3><strong><strong></strong>5. NCT Taeyong</strong></h3><p>NCT 127's 'Punch' era is among the NCTzen's favorites since the 127-squad kicked off a fuzzy electro backbone and flaunted sonic elements that are refreshing and experimental at the same time.</p><p>However, NCT 127 leader shared that wearing a harness outfit is both "uncomfortable" and "painful."</p><p>As Taeyong wore the harness and a short-sleeved vest top with no inner shirt, the chains happened to hit his torso.</p><p>Watch the fancam <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>:<br></p><p>As NCTzens noticed this, they cannot help but feel the bruising pain that the 'Punch' rapper is feeling whenever wearing the harness-based outfit.
