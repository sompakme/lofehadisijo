Overall, <a href=# rel>he has his Las Vegas residency which has proven to be a massive success</a>. Moreover, he is going to be performing at the Super Bowl in February, which is going to be a whole lot of fun. At this point in his career, he is getting his flowers, and it is truly nice to see. With the excitement for his Super Bowl performance mounting, it feels like we have seen a bit more of him recently. For instance, he was at a <a href=# rel>Balenciaga Fashion show this past weekend.</a></p><p>Unfortunately, Usher was utterly roasted for his choice of attire for the show. As you can see in the Instagram post below, the singer was wearing a face mask that had randomly cut holes all the way throughout. He also had on some wild boots, some crazy pants, a blazer, and what appeared to be a turtleneck. It was an absolutely ridiculous get-up, and he was promptly destroyed for it on social media. @fitaintnothing on IG showed no mercy, as can be seen in the caption below.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Usher Knows Better Than To Sing To Dwyane Wade’s Wife At Concert</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-usher-shown-no-mercy>Usher Shown No Mercy</h2></span><p>"RAYMOND! .. I know you made ALOT of confessions in yo life time but let me confess to you my boi THIS SH*T AINT NOTHIN MCMUFFIN," the caption reads. "You make me wanna whoop yo ass. oooo weeee. Shawty went paper snowflake cut stocking on the face and Mickey Mouse white gloves. They should LET YOU AND IT BURN right on in a dumpster." In the comments section, fans continued to pile on. "He show up in that shit during the Super Bowl they gone escort him off the field immediately," oner person said. "Them boots is so nasty," said another.</p><p>While these are all harsh critiques, they serve as a "what not to do" for when Usher takes the stage in February. Hopefully, he doesn't take it too personally. Let us know what you think of the outfit, in the comments section below. Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for more news and updates from around the music world.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Usher On Being Selected For Super Bowl Halftime Show: “Honor Of A Lifetime”</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZ312hJhmrKyglad6sMHTn6CtZZKWuaa6wqKYoJldqLWww4yhoKllmKS9brrEsKo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-nyc-how-many-stops-act.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is NYC How Many Stops Act</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tinashe-twerks-her-way-into-her-27th-birthday-watch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tinashe Twerks Her Way Into Her 27th Birthday: Watch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
