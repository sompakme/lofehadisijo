"You don’t want to over spray and weigh the hair down with product. I then like to use a ceramic flat iron to&nbsp;press&nbsp;from the roots to the ends.&nbsp;After all the hair is pressed, you will wrap all the hair in a clockwise circle pattern and secure with a sliver flat clip—make sure it’s not a duckbill clip, because that will leave an indentation in the hair. You will then take a roll of plastic wrap and wrap it around the hair to mold the hair to your head shape. Sit under the dryer for five minutes, then remove the plastic and comb your hair out into your desired style."</p><p>And voilà— your silk press is complete!&nbsp;</p><p>Parker concludes that to maintain your silk press, you can wrap it in plastic wrap once again or pin curl it, then use a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g34968974/best-silk-hair-wraps/>satin or silk hair wrap</a> to protect the style and prevent breakage.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-finding-the-right-flat-iron-for-a-silk-press><span>Finding the Right Flat Iron for a Silk Press</span></h2><p>If, like me, you're wary of heat tools for fear of causing long-term damage, Parker reassures that there are measures you can take to ensure that your silk press technique doesn't ruin your crown of curls.</p><p>"To protect your hair doing a&nbsp;silk&nbsp;press&nbsp;you must always use heat protection and do a test strand in the back to determine your heat setting," she says. "Don’t just automatically turn the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a27842/best-hair-straighteners/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-hair-straighteners/>flat iron</a> to the highest setting. Make sure you choose it based&nbsp;on how straight you want your hair." And for the sake of your strand strength, the lower the heat, the better!</p><p>And because you don't want to run your flat iron over your hair over and over again, it's important to invest in a high-quality flat iron that suits your hair type so that you can get the job done safely and effectively.</p><p>"For fine, thin, easy-to-curl hair, always look for a ceramic flat iron," says Parker. "It transmits&nbsp;heat through infrared technology and straightens from the inside out, which is&nbsp;more&nbsp;gentle, doesn’t pull or tug, and is less prone to heat damage."</p><p>On the other hand, she describes, "For thicker,&nbsp;courser hair, a titanium flat iron would be better because it discharges negative particles. This helps to seal the&nbsp;normal moisture in your hair, making it&nbsp;shinier&nbsp;and&nbsp;gets it&nbsp;smooth quicker."</p><p>Finally, she tells clients to ensure that their flat irons have a digital dial that controls its level of heat. "You want to be able&nbsp;to&nbsp;set your temperature&nbsp;instead of having a&nbsp;preset flat iron," she explains.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-flat-irons-for-a-silk-press><span>The Best Flat Irons for a Silk Press</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Evolve Ionic Salon Hair Flat Iron" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Artist-Evolve-Long-Lasting-Finish-Straightening/dp/B07KSFP9QZ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FArtist-Evolve-Long-Lasting-Finish-Straightening%2Fdp%2FB07KSFP9QZ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dEQsgzRKYQ2nfFBbcDChrL-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Ceramic Flat Iron for Silk Presses</span></p></a><p>Hot Tools Pro Artist Black Gold Evolve Ionic Salon Hair Flat Iron</p><p>Parker specifically recommends this flat iron for achieving the perfect silk press.
