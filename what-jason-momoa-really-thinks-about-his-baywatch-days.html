The actor starred in the Hawaiian spin-off of the hit show from 1999 through 2001: at the time, he was just 19 years old. Everyone had to get their start somewhere, right? But while the actor appeared in a popular show, that doesn't mean he's going to go around bragging about it.</p><p dir=ltr>When speaking on the Australian radio show "Fitzy and Wippa" in 2021, the "Aquaman" star admitted that "Baywatch" isn't a regular topic of conversation among his two kids, whom he shares with his now-ex, Lisa Bonet. "We don't say the B-word at home. We hide all of that, mate!" he said of the show. "Never happened, mate! We don't talk about those words. The B-word didn't happen." Momoa also shared that he doesn't let his children see the "earlier things" in his career, but he's allowing them to watch his more recent works that involve superheroes rather than films like "Conan the Barbarian."</p><p dir=ltr>In another interview with <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>,&nbsp;Momoa talked about the irony of landing the role of "Aquaman," all those years later, which has a similar shirtless vibe as the role that he once played on the lifeguard series. "It's a trip," he told the outlet. "I spent 15 years trying to dig myself out of the 'Baywatch'&nbsp;hole, and now I'm Aquaman. Life is very good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmbYN1fo6wn5qsXZ%2ButLvNZqSopZ%2BWerOxwKWjsmWknbavt9JmmJunpal6qbXSZpmasaeWwaS0jJ2Ysqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-dr-tina-viceral-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Dr. Tina Viceral? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-safest-retirement-investment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the safest retirement investment?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
