She belonged to a <strong>Mexican-Scottish ancestry, her father,</strong></p><p>Albert Baez being born in Puebla, Mexico and her mother,<strong> Joan Baez</strong> being born in Edinburgh, Scotland. <strong>Joan Chandos’ fathe</strong>r immigrated to the USA along with his family when he was only two years old. He was brought up in Brooklyn, New York. She was the second child among the three daughters of Albert and Joan Baez family.</p><p>Her mother was often referred to as <strong>Joan Senior or Big Joan.</strong> From her early childhood days, Joan had to suffer racial discrimination which often included <strong>abusive slurs hurled</strong> against her mainly due to her Mexican origin and the inheritance of her <strong>father’s</strong> <strong>dark complexion.</strong></p><p>However, the onslaught of such racism did not deter her from pursuing her in-<strong>born musical talent.</strong> She also got herself involved with many social causes, fighting for a variety of social,<strong> political and economic issues</strong> during her early teen itself.</p><p><strong>Joan Baez</strong> earned her high school graduation from Palo Alto High School in 1958. She frequented many American and foreign cities of France, Canada, England, Spain, Switzerland and also the Middle East due to her father’s research, teaching position, work in health care sector and his association with UNESCO during her growing years.</p><p>She had to spend a year in <strong>war-ravaged Iraq</strong> when she was only ten years old. She witnessed the poor condition of the common people of that country and the <strong>utter violation of human rights</strong> <strong>prevailing at that time in Iraq</strong>.</p><p>Her <strong>involvement in social activism </strong>later in her career was influenced by all these <strong>racial discriminations </strong>she suffered during her early life and the suffering of people she witnessed while staying in different countries, <strong>particularly Iraq.</strong></p><p>In 1958, her family<strong> moved to Massachusetts</strong>, when her father accepted a faculty position at MIT. There she got herself enrolled at the Theatre School of the Boston University.</p><p><strong>Joan Baez</strong> did not find her experience at the University congenial and abandoned her course only after studying for six weeks there. However, Boston and Cambridge at that time were fast becoming the <strong>center of the folk music culture</strong>, and Joan began to sing in different venues in and around the city of Boston and nearby Cambridge.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><br><h2>Career</h2><p>Joan Baez gave her<strong> first concert in 1958</strong> when she performed at the <strong>Club 47 in Cambridge.</strong> For the first concert, Joan Baez was<strong> paid</strong> <strong>$10 </strong>and was asked to r<strong>egularly perform there for $25 per show</strong>.

She altogether produced eight Gold albums and one Gold single, ample proof of her popularity as a singer of the highest quality.</p><p>Her fourth album <strong>‘Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2’ published in 1963 </strong>featured hitherto unknown personality Bob Dylan, who later became the face of popular music and culture in America for five decades and even received a Nobel Prize for literature in 2016. Joan was instrumental in giving Bob Dylan an early career boost by introducing him in her album.</p><p>Joan’s few memorable songs include “There But for Fortune,” “Diamonds and Rust”, "We Shall Overcome," "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" and "It's All Over Now Baby Blue".</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2>Career As a Political Activist</h2><p>Apart from her singing and musical <strong>talent as a singer-songwriter</strong> and an acclaimed guitarist, <strong>Joan Baez is a very popular Civil Rights</strong>, Anti-War, Women’s Rights, Environmental and Children’s Activist.
