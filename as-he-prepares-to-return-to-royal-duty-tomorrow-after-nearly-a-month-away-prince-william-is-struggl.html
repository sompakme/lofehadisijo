William will begin the day in Sunbury-on-Thames to see how a food charity called Surplus to Supper delivers, sorts, and repackages unused food to community groups, and soon after, he will visit a youth center in West London that receives regular deliveries of the surplus food and distributes the items to people in need, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-william-to-resume-royal-duties-after-kate-middletons-diagnosis/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Us Weekly</u> </a>reports.</p><p>Though William may have been away from work, “It’s been stressful,” a source told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-william-struggles-with-pressure-as-kate-charles-fight-cancer/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Us Weekly</u></a> about William caring for Kate and his three kids during this tumultuous time for the family. “William feels a profound sense of duty to uphold the monarchy’s stability and inspire confidence in the public that everything will be okay.

While William has put on a brave face publicly, a source told Us Weekly that William, naturally, feels “helpless and scared” with his wife’s diagnosis and has been asking other members of the royal family to fill in for him as far as royal duties go so he is able to be more present at home.</p><p>“He’s got young children, a sick wife and a sick dad, and memories of losing his mom [Princess Diana] early,” royal biographer Dr. Tessa Dunlop said. “There’s a lot at stake, and he does need support.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the one-two punch of Charles’ and Kate’s cancer diagnoses, William “shut down for a couple of days,” a source speaking to Us Weekly said. “He canceled all meetings and spent time with Kate. Then he picked himself back up again, because he knew it was up to him to be strong for the whole family.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atLp2iMWnzYJCMc9eNGCEg-1920-80.png><p>William has been seen out recently at a pub in Norfolk with his mother-in-law, Carole, and at a soccer game with his eldest, George.
