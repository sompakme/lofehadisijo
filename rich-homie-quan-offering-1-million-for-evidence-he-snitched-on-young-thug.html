Moreover, he put up a $1 million offer if anyone online could provide any sort of evidence that he told on someone. For those unaware, accusations against the rapper stem from a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">leaked audio clip</a> of him allegedly speaking on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>'s RICO case. The two were former collaborators, and iconic ones at that, but things soured along the way for much-speculated reasons. Regardless of all that, the Atlanta MC maintains that people calling him a rat are dead in the wrong.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Did I snitch?" Rich Homie Quan remarked during a recent Instagram Live session. "N***a, my name ain't in no paperwork, bruh. Suck my d**k. Did you suck one this morning? Get you out of body, young man. Did I snitch... N***a, find my name in some paperwork, bro, and I'll give you a million dollars. We can trade lives, on God." Of course, he didn't directly reference Thugger in these remarks, but fans can connect the dots quite easily.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rich-homie-quan-denies-snitching-allegations>Rich Homie Quan Denies Snitching Allegations</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, this is what Rich Homie Quan's manager, Rich Homie Monta, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">had to say about these snitching allegations</a>. "I don't think [there's] a man in this world [that's] never&nbsp;talked about some type of business&nbsp;or some type of way they felt," he remarked. "All you p***y-a** n***as do that. I don't give a f**k who you talking to." Not only that, but he said they don't engage in "street culture" anymore, suggesting that everyone "snitches" sooner or later and that it's easy to "talk a little bit too much." As such, many saw this as vague confirmation that the 34-year-old rapper did speak on Thug's case, but maybe didn't have any actual impact in it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, what do you think about these accusations and the situation that Young Thug is in the middle of?

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures.
