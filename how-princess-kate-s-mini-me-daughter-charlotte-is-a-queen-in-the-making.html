brothers currently attend the private school Lambrook in Berkshire, near her family home on the Windsor Estate.</p><p id=eeqJkK3htkg data-wc=44>There is much talk of which secondary school the children will go on to, with nearby Eton College a known preference for royal boys. Their mother Kate attended the prestigious&nbsp;Marlborough College between 1996 and 2000 and was spotted visiting the school in 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c618110537d-gettyimages-1243027415.jpg><p id=eMCsd5jhWXX data-wc=21>The mother-of-three enjoyed her time at Marlborough so it's very likely that Charlotte may follow in her footsteps and study there.</p><p id=ekgkolL4eZ1 data-wc=29>The £46,995-per-year co-educational independent boarding school&nbsp;is&nbsp;based in Wiltshire,&nbsp;and welcomes pupils aged 13 to 18. Facilities include an indoor swimming pool, tennis court and an athletics track.</p><p id=e-QLowTQz2r data-wc=23>While Marlborough is a fair distance from Windsor, it would give the young princess an education fit for a life of royal duty.</p><p id=evpvBGAyFoB data-wc=43>The late Queen Elizabeth II was educated at home as was standard at the time for girls from wealthy families. In preparation for her role as monarch, she studied constitutional history and law, and was educated in religion by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebTI02kZqF data-wc=19>The young queen also learnt French and enjoyed art and music. One would expect Charlotte to study similar subjects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d2db1b49def5-charlotte-kate.jpg><h2>Sporting pursuits</h2><p id=en5YpZmbpc38 data-wc=33>Senior royals tend to enjoy an active lifestyle; the late Queen was a lifelong fan of horse riding and as a young girl she was a Girl Guide and then a Sea Ranger.</p><p id=eCcXPRIaaw9N data-wc=44>We've seen Kate get her children involved in scouting on royal visits to Scout units and they appeared to thrive joining in with the group activities. Charlotte also has a passion for horse riding, which fits in perfectly with the royal family's' preferred activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8883fff03639-charlotte-archery.jpg><p id=ekR1HSjw9CjC data-wc=19>We can just imagine seeing Charlotte riding around royal estates and cheering on her horses at Ascot one day.</p><p id=eh154QAoQr7A data-wc=37>The young princess is certainly a delightful young lady and is already displaying the qualities needed to fulfill royal duties.
