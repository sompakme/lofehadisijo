The first two films, Don (2006) and Don 2 (2011) were blockbuster hits that showcased the charismatic and ruthless criminal mastermind, Don, played by Khan, and his cat-and-mouse game with the law enforcement agencies.</p><p>However, it has been almost a decade since the last film was released, and there has been no official announcement about <strong>Don 3</strong>. Rumors and speculations have been rife about the cast, plot, and release date of the much-anticipated sequel, but nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><p>But now, there is some good news for the fans of the franchise. Producer Ritesh Sidhwani, who is Farhan Akhtar’s partner at Excel Entertainment, has revealed that Don 3 is currently in the scripting stage and that Akhtar is almost done with the writing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Scripting Stage</strong></h2><p>Sidhwani, who has produced movies such as Dil Chahta Hai, Rock On!!, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, and Raees, said that he is not aware of the plot details of Don 3 as of now. He said that they will not do anything until Akhtar finishes writing the script.</p><p>Sidhwani also said that they are not in a hurry to make Don 3 and that they want to make it with perfection. He said that they are not under any pressure from the fans or the industry to make the sequel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Don 3 Movie Cast and Release Date</strong></h2><p>Sidhwani did not reveal anything about the cast and release date of Don 3. However, it is widely expected that Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra Jonas will reprise their roles as Don and Roma, respectively. The two actors have sizzling chemistry on screen and have a huge fan following across the globe.</p><p>There have also been reports that Akhtar might play a pivotal role in Don 3, apart from directing it. Akhtar had a cameo appearance in Don 2 as one of Don’s associates. It is possible that he might expand his role in the sequel and join Khan and Chopra Jonas in the action.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Don-3-Movie-Cast-and-Release-Date.jpg><p>As for the release date, there is no official word on it yet. But given that Akhtar is almost done with the script, it is likely that the film will go on floors soon and hit the screens sometime in 2024 or 2025.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Cult Franchise</strong></h2><p>Don is a cult franchise that has a loyal fan base across generations. The franchise is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, starring Amitabh Bachchan in the titular role. Excel Entertainment bought the rights of the original film and remade it with Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra Jonas in the lead.</p><p>The first film, Don (2006), was a modern adaptation of the original story, with some twists and turns. The film was a commercial and critical success and established Khan as one of the most stylish and charismatic actors in Bollywood.</p><p>The second film, Don 2 (2011), was a sequel that took the story forward from where the first film ended. The film showed Don’s escapades in Europe and his plan to rob a bank in Berlin. The film was also a hit and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.</p><p>The franchise is known for its sleek action sequences, stylish cinematography, catchy music, witty dialogues, and thrilling plot twists. The franchise also has a global appeal and has been dubbed in several languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Arabic, German, French, Turkish, and English.</p><p>Don 3 is one of the most awaited films in Bollywood and has high expectations from fans and critics alike.
