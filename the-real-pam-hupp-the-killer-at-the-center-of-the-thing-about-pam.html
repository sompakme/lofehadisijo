But on Tuesday, December 27, 2011, upon returning to his home in Troy, Missouri, Faria made a grisly discovery. His wife, Betsy, was dead. She had been stabbed more than 50 times and the knife still protruded from her neck.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Calling 911, Russ told the dispatchers that his wife may have killed herself. She had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer earlier that year and had a history of threatening suicide. But investigators didn’t buy his story. Betsy’s death was far too brutal, and Russ was going in and out of hysteria during the 911 call, which led investigators to believe "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=4792" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his demeanor was staged" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">his demeanor was staged</a>."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following morning, Russ was arrested and charged with Betsy’s murder.

She claimed Russ was an aggressive drinker who verbally abused Betsy. Despite convincing evidence of his innocence—four alibis, the cellphone data, and a lack of blood on his clothes— the prosecutor accused the alibi witnesses of plotting “the ultimate role play,” per a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fox2now.com/news/pam-hupp/heres-how-faria-prosecutors-got-their-wrongful-conviction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FOX 2 local news report" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">FOX 2 local news report</a>.

She tried to explain that $100,000 would be set up in a trust for Betsy’s daughters. The other $50,000? “My other girlfriend died of breast cancer in August,” Pam said at the trial, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stlmag.com/longform/pam-hupp/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="St. Louis" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">St. Louis</a> magazine, “and she has a 12-year-old daughter that I’m trying to help.” As it turns out, the daughter’s friend never received any help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Russ spent three years in prison before he was acquitted in the 2015 retrial.
