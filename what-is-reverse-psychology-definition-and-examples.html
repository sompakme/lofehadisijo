It is a strategy where a person is persuaded to do something by asking them to do the exact opposite. It is some mind game where one plays with another person's mindset and uses it to their advantage.</p><h2>Reverse psychology definition</h2><p class=align-left>What do you mean by reverse psychology? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Cambridge dictionary,</a> it is a method of trying to make someone do what you want by asking them to do the opposite and expecting them to disagree with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Stanbic IBTC Pension: Every ‘Someday’ needs a plan</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While the definition of this type of psychology looks a bit complex, it takes a closer look at it to understand and appreciate its workings. A closer examination of the term refers to a method of trying to make someone do what you want by asking them to do the opposite and expecting them to disagree with you.</p><h3>Who invented reverse psychology?</h3><p class=align-left>The idea was first conceived by scientists named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Adorno and Horkhiemer</a>. The two developed the reverse psychology theory in which people respond to the reverse of what they want to do. The two named their theory <i>Psychoanalysis in Reverse</i>.</p><h3>Does reverse psychology work?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e5084ac5b12752fa.jpg><p class=align-left>Now when we understand what reverse psychology is about, the big question is whether it works or not. Those who apply it vouch for the effectiveness of the strategy in different situations. It is a strategy for getting what you want by demanding what you don't want.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b524fb8024e3fad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Kanye West to give back his music artistes 50% of their masters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Scientists refer to it as a strategic self-anticonformity because your communicated demand goes directly against what you want. Instead of communicating your wishes directly, you tend to hide them and instead opt to ask for the contrary with the intention to attain similar or better results.</p><p class=align-left>When applying reverse psychology, you tend to use words that indicate what someone must do, even though you want them to do the opposite. The emphasis is laid all through, and the message is communicated without any doubts.</p><p class=align-left>It tends to take advantage of natural reactance. This is a psychological term referring to the uncomfortable feeling you get when you feel as though your freedom is being threatened. The natural response to reactance is to do the opposite of what is demanded.</p><p class=align-left>On the question of whether it works or not, the truth is that it does. However, there is no one-answer-fits-all solution. In some cases, an attempt at reverse psychology will be a major flop.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ddd78cc6a1b731a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>It's a trap to promote toxic behavior - Toke Makinwa speaks on finding closure from broken relationships (video)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For the strategy to work, though, first, the target must never know that you are playing a trick on them because they will play along and react differently. It is also necessary that they believe the ruse, and actually trust that you want them to do what you are asking before they react in the opposite way.</p><h3>How do people use reverse psychology?</h3><p class=align-left>Well, once you define reverse psychology and understand its power, you can apply it practically in any field to make things work for you. Some of the areas that have been immensely used include:</p><li><strong>In Sales</strong>: To become an excellent salesperson, you may need to apply this strategy. The popular <i>Door in the Face</i> technique is an example of its application. The technique begins with the salesperson making an outrageous and thoroughly impressive sales pitch. The pressure then sets in, and the target customer begins to feel the need to purchase. However, in most cases, the salesperson is not looking to make this particular sale. He or she may be trying to provoke the prospective consumer to push back, and present a smaller offer, to which the consumer is likely to feel less reactance and more comfortable to take.</li><li><strong>In Marketing:</strong> Just like in sales, the marketing sector has benefited from the effects of reverse psychology. It has been used in popularizing high-end stores. The idea is to create an illusion that the services are offered to all people. It is only after you walk in that you realize the prizes and target market is specific.</li><li><strong>Parenting: </strong>Parenting is undoubtedly one of the most difficult jobs in the world since it is continuous and consistent. It would help if you were a smart parent to know how to get your child to do what you want without making it too obvious. Sometimes what a child wants may bring a conflict of interest that is detrimental to them. If not handled properly, it may end up causing harm than gain in the future. Tactfully, parents should learn how to balance, allowing their kids to develop their own Independence while at the same time controlling the excesses. This is where reverse psychology comes in. Your kid does not have to know that you are playing him or her.</li><li><strong>In Teaching</strong>: Talk to any teacher, and you will see a trend that recurs, especially when they are teaching on hard subjects. As such, most of them have learned how to use reverse psychology to make their students get interested in the topic and subject they are teaching.</li><li><strong>Reverse psychology in relationships</strong>: While in most cases, this strategy can be positively used, it can become problematic when applied in relationship setups. Usually, it comes off as manipulative and even psycho if it goes overboard. When tow people are supposed to love and cherish each other, mind games should not be involved. It is possible for a partner to start losing faith in the other when the patterns start showing because they will show after a while. The relationship will be one-sided, and the manipulative one will seem like he or she is in control.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9da79168c0c6d0d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>We are not hiding again - Rapper Ikechukwu says as he finally shows off girlfriend (photo)</span></p></a><h3>Reverse psychology example and case studies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7f87f702f1c972b2.jpg><p class=align-left>While it has been praised to work, it is only by looking at what has happened before that anyone can truly appreciate its true potential. Below are a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">few instances </a>where the strategy can clearly be seen in the play.</p><ul><li>Today is Mike’s birthday. His sister hasn’t bought him a present yet. Their father suggests that the reason why she hasn’t purchased a present is that she is stingy, and maybe doesn’t love her brother. The result? She purchases a nice present for her brother.</li></ul><p class=align-left>In the case above, the father knows that his daughter is none of the things he described her to be. She may have been reluctant about the whole idea of buying a present for her brother hence did not focus on that. Her father's intention was to prompt her to do what she had not planned for.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/002bb749b18f4832.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian man shows great confidence, proposes to lady on aeroplane, see how people responded (video)</span></p></a><ul><li>Nancy has a friend who has a reputation for not helping others. There is a concert they want to attend, but Nancy's mother has a list of chores that need to be done first. Nancy gets to work, but her friend sits on the couch and turns on the TV. “Fine,” Nancy tells her friend. “Don’t bother helping. See if I care about going to the concert.” This causes her friend to start helping.</li></ul><p class=align-left>This sounds like manipulation, but if you have a friend that takes advantage of others, then you can pull the string to get him or her to act. Just be careful to know which situations to apply the trick. It may not work for all cases, especially if your threat does not touch on something important to them.</p><ul><li>James has always been rather shy. It’s been tough for him to make friends. He’s never had a girlfriend, but he really likes Rosey. He just hasn’t gotten the courage to ask her out on a date. He goes out to the bar with his friends, and Rosey happens to be there. Jame’s friends encourage him to ask her out, but he refuses. “Maybe you just don’t like girls?” his friend suggests. James then asks Rosey out to prove them wrong.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/353c71ddc73373ab.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lifestyle: 8 superb clothing hacks that'll change your life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The insinuation that James could not be into girls gets him to act despite his shyness. He may never have approached the girl if he had not been provoked.</p><p class=align-left>Reverse psychology is a phenomenon that can work to encourage or discourage someone from doing something. The fact that you rely on persuading someone to attempt what they may not want to do just because you imply the opposite is brilliant.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR8l2puamWnna61edGerZ6qo5p6sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2Bcxm6wxJ%2Bgp6GknryvecSxmKaonJrAb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-rick-harrison-s-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Rick HarrisonS Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rich-homie-quan-offering-1-million-for-evidence-he-snitched-on-young-thug.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rich Homie Quan Offering $1 Million For Evidence He Snitched On Young Thug</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
