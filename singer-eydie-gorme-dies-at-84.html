She was 84.</p><p>Gorme, who also had a huge solo hit in 1963 with “Blame it on the Bossa Nova,” died Saturday at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas following a brief, undisclosed illness, said her publicist, <strong>Howard Bragman</strong>.</p><p>Gorme was a successful band singer and nightclub entertainer when she was invited to join the cast of <strong>Steve Allen</strong>‘s local New York television show in 1953.</p><p>She sang solos and also did duets and comedy skits with Lawrence, a rising young singer who had joined the show a year earlier. When the program became NBC’s Tonight Show in 1954, the young couple went with it.</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2013</strong></a></p><p>They married in Las Vegas in 1957 and later performed for audiences there. Lawrence, the couple’s son <strong>David</strong> and other loved ones were by her side when she died, Bragman said.</p><p>“Eydie has been my partner on stage and in life for more than 55 years,” Lawrence said in a statement. “I fell in love with her the moment I saw her and even more the first time I heard her sing. While my personal loss is unimaginable, the world has lost one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time.”</p><p>Although usually recognized for her musical partnership with Lawrence, Gorme broke through on her own with the Grammy-nominated “Blame it on the Bossa Nova.” The bouncy tune about a dance craze of the time was written by the Tin Pan Alley songwriting team of <strong>Barry Mann</strong> and <strong>Cynthia Weil</strong>.</p><p>Her husband had had an equally huge solo hit in 1962 with “Go Away Little Girl,” written by the songwriting team of <strong>Gerry Goffin</strong> and <strong>Carole King</strong>.</p><p>Gorme would score another solo hit in 1964, but this time for a Spanish-language recording.</p><p>Gorme, who was born in New York City to Sephardic Jewish parents, grew up speaking both English and Spanish. When she and her husband were at the height of their career as a team in 1964, Columbia Records President <strong>Goddard Lieberson</strong> suggested she put that Spanish to use in the recording studio.</p><p>The result was “Amor,” recorded with the Mexican combo Trio Los Panchos.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Before Burbank: 5 Portraits of ‘The Tonight Show’ in New York</a></strong></p><p>The song became a hit throughout Latin America, which resulted in more recordings for the Latino market, and Lawrence and Gorme performed as a duo throughout Latin America.</p><p>“Our Spanish stuff outsells our English recordings,” Lawrence said in 2004. “She’s like a diva to the Spanish world.”</p><p>Gorme and Lawrence, meanwhile, had an impressive, long-lasting career in English-language music as well, encompassing recordings and appearances on TV, in nightclubs and in concert halls.</p><p>Throughout it, they stuck for the most part with the music of classic composers like Berlin, Kern, Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and other giants of Broadway and Hollywood musicals. They eschewed rock ‘n’ roll and made no apologies for it.</p><p>“People come with a general idea of what they’re going to get,” Lawrence said of their show in a 1989 interview. “They buy a certain cereal, and they know what to expect from that package.”</p><p>Soon after their marriage, the pair had landed their own TV program, The Steve Lawrence and Eydie&nbsp;Gorme Show, which was a summer replacement for Allen.</p><p>Not long after that, however, Lawrence entered the Army, and Gorme went on the nightclub circuit as a soloist until his return to civilian life two years later.</p><p>After his discharge, Lawrence and Gorme quickly reteamed, and their careers took off.</p><p>They appeared at leading nightclubs in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Las Vegas, combining music with the comedy bits they had learned during their apprenticeship on Allen’s show.</p><p>With nightclubs dwindling in popularity in the 1980s, they moved their act to large theaters and auditoriums, drawing not only older audiences but also the Baby Boomers who had grown up on rock ‘n’ roll.</p><p>Gorme, who was born Aug. 16, 1928, began to seriously consider a music career while still a student at William Taft High School in New York City’s borough of the Bronx, where she had been voted the “Prettiest, Peppiest Cheerleader.”</p><p>After graduation, she worked as a Spanish interpreter for a time but also sang on weekends with the band of Ken Greenglass, who encouraged her and eventually became her manager.</p><p>Her first big break came when she landed a tour with the Tommy Tucker band, and she followed that up with gigs with <strong>Tex Beneke</strong>, <strong>Ray Eberle</strong> and on radio and television. Among her radio appearances was one on a Spanish language show, Cita Con Eydie (A“), which was beamed to Latin America by Voice of America.</p><p>Early in her career, Gorme considered changing her name, but her mother protested.</p><p>“It’s bad enough that you’re in show business. How will the neighbors know if you’re ever a success?” she told her, so Gorme decided to keep the family name but changed her given name from Edith to Edie.</p><p>Later, having grown tired of people mistaking it for Eddie, she changed the spelling to Eydie.</p><p>She is survived by Lawrence, her son David and a granddaughter. Her other son with Lawrence, Michael, died of heart failure in 1986 at age 23.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Botq%2BzxKtknrGUnrJus86rpJ5llJ6ytHnArWRvaGNtfXJ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teena-marie-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teena Marie Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./released-wwe-star-wanted-to-bring-back-undashing-cody-rhodes-gimmick.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Released WWE Star Wanted To Bring Back Undashing Cody Rhodes Gimmick</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
