But how does it fare against some of the highest-grossing animated movies of all time? Looking at the list, the sequel to <strong>Frozen </strong>sits in first place with $1.45 billion and the first Frozen movie moved down to third with $1.28 billion. Should the <strong>Mario Bros</strong><strong><a href=#>film </a></strong>remain in theatres for at least a few more weeks, they will definitely have a chance at defeating <strong>Frozen II</strong>. If this happens, this would be a significant win for <strong>Universal </strong>against <strong>Disney</strong>. But what the Super Mario Bros film has done truly defies even the most unthinkable odds.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Super Mario Bros is a videogame-based project done right</h2><p>For many years, making a great series or movie that was based in a videogame was considered impossible. Many tried doing their best and failed at least in one category to consider. Whether it was the story, the medium, or even the production of the film. There was always something that made it lack a certain something that made it a success. Super Mario is the very first videogame-based film that becomes part of the billion dollar club. But what did they do right? In the past, other films such as the Sonic franchise, Tomb Raider, or Pokemon tried their shot at doing it live action. But for some reason, there wasn't anybody who actually tried doing it in animation.</p><p>People who play videogames want to feel that nostalgia aspect that triggers their memories and live action does a poor job at that. Even if the Super Mario Bros story is not great, that nostalgia factor does play a huge part in the film's success. On a side note, the actual most successful animated movie of all time is the "live action" The Lion King but that one is not considered animated because they still have Mowgli starring in it in live action form. With this level of success, Universal Studios has a great chance to create their own Nintendo Universe by exploring other meorable stories of the videogame company. The question is: Will they be animated or live action? Elsa, Olaf, and company had a good run. It was fun while it lasted but there's a new animated king in town. It'sa him, Mario!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mpq%2Bhlah8c3yRbGZpbl9lf3CCk3BwbJqRmH9zgo9qm21qZWiFo4CUmnBnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toni-storm-turns-heads-in-cheeky-leather-photo-drop.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toni Storm Turns Heads In Cheeky Leather Photo Drop</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stuart-nisbet-dead-character-actor-was-82.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stuart Nisbet Dead: Character Actor Was 82</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
