Alisha Wainwright plays the mother, and ever since the series premiered, Netflix viewers have sparked a curiosity about her online.</p><p>More specifically, many viewers have been curious if she is related to the famous pop singer, Alicia Keys.</p><p>Who is Alisha Wainwright, and is she related to the powerhouse singer Alicia Keys? Here is everything to know about the breakout star of Raising Dion on Netflix and if she has any celebrity siblings.</p><h2>Who is Alisha Wainwright from Raising Dion?</h2><p>According to IMDb, Wainwright has only had a small career in the industry up until recently.

Jordan, who executive produced the series.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alisha Wainwright (@alishawainwright)</a></p><h2>Is Alisha Wainwright related to Alicia Keys?</h2><p>Since Raising Dion premiered, the online community is convinced she is related to the singer. So much so, they have taken to Twitter to exclaim the notion, and they will not be convinced differently.

Virtually nothing is known about who raised her, although there are claims that she was not an only child, spending her childhood with step-siblings.</p><p>What is even more interesting is that there appears to be no information about where she graduated high school.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, she graduated from the University of Florida and even began to prepare for a Ph.D. When she grew weary with fighting with her first love, science,&nbsp; she headed down the road to where she is now and moved to California to pursue acting.</p><p>Her very early childhood appears to have a lot blacked out or unknown, which makes her earlier life fascinating.</p><p>Her birthday is July 14, 1989, and her middle name is Ena. Some think she comes from an African American and Latino family, but there is no information to confirm that.</p><p>Wainwright, with her stellar start to her acting career, bears a striking resemblance to Alicia Keys. Still, there is no evidence or way to confirm that they are related, especially when one considers that this young woman up to this point has been a new face in Hollywood. Her time as a dedicated mother on Raising Dion is sure to change this, however.</p><p>Raising Dion is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiZnJ7Aqa2MsJiipqentqi002auoaddnsBuwMeeZKuZmai2r7OMnaCopl2owaK%2BjJqlnWWnncZusM5mp56noKGybsDHoqWkZaOdsm610mapnqSRqbKledOoZJqkmZi2onnKnrCsZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./quavo-offset-kid-cudi-walk-in-virgil-abloh-s-memorial-louis-vuitton-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Quavo, Offset &amp;amp; Kid Cudi Walk In Virgil Abloh's Memorial Louis Vuitton Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-hires-jpmorgan-for-advice-on-sale-talks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWE Hires JPMorgan For Advice On Sale Talks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
