So when her eponymous beauty brand launched Stateside a few years later in 2016, we couldn't wait to get our hands on the makeup products we were certain would change our lives.

We've long been enamored with Tilbury's beauty philosophy, which is centered on the idea that every woman is just as beautiful bare-faced as she is wearing full glam. The overall goal of makeup, according to Tilbury, is to feel gorgeous and empowered — a sentiment we are fully on board with. And when it comes to Tilbury's makeup, it'd be hard to not feel confident while wearing anything she created because everything simply oozes glamour, from the gold-gilded hues that deliver an all-over glow, right down to the flashy product names (Supernudes Nudegasm Face Palette, anyone? Or Goddess Cleansing Ritual?).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you've been a Charlotte Tilbury loyalist for years or are just discovering the iconic brand, these are the absolute must-have products that our team of highly critical, glow-demanding editors swear by.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-universal-charlotte-tilbury-eyes-to-mesmerise-cream-eyeshadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Universal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Eyes To Mesmerize Cream Eyeshadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XiIRAU0l-B8TekpRXMRY9pwUJHI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-eyes-to-mesmerize-cream-eyeshadow-84499718b8144b27b36fca9734232479.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t know how else to say this, but when we swipe one of the Eyes to Mesmerize Cream Eyeshadows on our lids, we can’t help but feel like the sexiest, most put-together woman alive. There is something about these <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream eyeshadows</a> that make them stand out above the rest. Perhaps it’s the long-lasting formula, the gorgeous shade range across 12 hues, the ease of use, or the way that Charlotte uses them to expertly accentuate anyone’s eyes.</p><p>“Eyeshadow is not my strong suit, so for a one-and-done eye look, I love to use the shade Pillow Talk,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jasmine Hyman</a>, a writer and producer at InStyle. “The creamy eyeshadow is extremely beginner-friendly. It can be applied in one swipe and I even use my fingertips to blend it out. It has a subtle, yet iridescent finish that pairs well with any level of glam.”</p><p>We’ve never had an issue with creasing, although most of the time, we do use an eyeshadow primer first to make the pigment and shimmer last all day. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Mary Honkus</a>, commerce editor at InStyle, also relies on Pillow Talk to pull her look together in a snap.</p><p>“Pillow Talk is the brand’s most iconic shade and it never fails to make my blue eyes pop,” she says. “Spending $35 for one eyeshadow pot may seem like a lot, but I’ve had mine for two years and it's still half full — the tiniest dab is all I need to create a high-impact, low-effort everyday eye look.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 0.23 fl oz | <strong>Shades</strong>: 11 | <strong>Feature</strong>: Highly pigmented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multitasking-charlotte-tilbury-filmstar-bronze--glow-contour-duo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Multitasking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Bronze & Glow Contour Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze &amp;amp; Glow Contour Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/u3x0PfPaxn2MDkJWixsRrv4NUzU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-filmstar-bronze--glow-contour-duo-6fe869ae8acd49c4927c6b9c44f1376a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We've gone through about six of these Filmstar palettes over the last ten-ish years.

It’s important to note that the contour shade is not matte — the formula has a blend of pearl and pigments, so if you prefer a matte contour, this may not be for you. Opposite the contour is the gorgeous highlight. It has a golden base that really warms our complexion and provides a soft, diffused luminosity, not unlike the impossibly alluring way skin looks near candlelight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We use more of the contour shade than the highlighter, which means that we reach the bottom of the bronze pan faster than the highlighter, but we keep them anyway because they're just too pretty to toss them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 0.79 oz | <strong>Shades</strong>: 2 | <strong>Feature</strong>: Stunning, art deco-inspired packaging</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lipstick-charlotte-tilbury-hyaluronic-happikiss-lipstick-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lipstick</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Lipstick Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Hyaluronic Happikiss Lipstick Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hcaNvLEHW8S2D5cdRyTHMGo8hK4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HyaluronicHappikissLipstickBalm-81f5fd04522347818d52cb6e18d2c43e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Not quite a lipstick, but not quite a balm, this hybrid lippie is deeply nourishing with impressive color payoff.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Charlotte Tilbury’s lip products are legendary — and it’s not just us who think that.

And if you, like Alnuweiri, suffer from decision fatigue by the endless number of lip colors out there, you may find peace with Tilbury’s curated collection of 10 hues. Her favorites are a peachy-rose number called Romance Kiss and of course, Pillow Talk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle

It’s luxuriously rich, hydrates the skin beautifully, smells nice, and works wonders as a primer under makeup. We must admit that due to our very sensitive skin, we don’t use this decadent moisturizer daily, as it can sometimes clog our pores with overuse. However, on days that we need an instant shot of moisture to our skin or are planning to do full-on glam, there's nothing better than this moisturizer to create a dewy base for foundation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Magic Cream started out as a secret formula that Tilbury used on models backstage to prep their skin for the layers of runway makeup that were about to be applied.

It is reserved for Special Events Only, like vacations or weddings. It’s one of those palettes that has basically every shade we need for both our face and our eyes, allowing us to streamline our routine for our most important events.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really love that these palettes come with the Filmstar Bronze and Glow shades, which we rely on to create multidimensional looks. When jetting out of town, we like to pack this palette instead of the bulkier, kind of heavy Filmstar duo palette. Plus, there's nothing better than this eyeshadow trio to create a soft eyeshadow look when we're having a relaxing long weekend (going all out with a time-consuming smokey eye look would ruin the zen vibe).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest downside with the Look of Love Palettes is that all seven shades are limited edition. In fact, the palette that first stole our heart has been discontinued, but the two colorways that are still available, Glowing Beauty and Pretty Blushed Beauty, are just as striking and now that we've had them in our lives, we doubt that we could go on without them. If you're a world traveler or you simply don't travel light, even around your neighborhood (we definitely don't, so no judgment here), we highly suggest investing in one of these palettes.

The rest, she says, is history.&nbsp;</p><p>“The formula is creamy and hydrating, which is perfect for my notoriously dry under eyes, but it blends easily and melts into my skin rather than sitting on top,” she says.</p><p>While many concealers have a dewy finish, this one isn’t. Although it’s not entirely matte either. It looks just like skin, only airbrushed, which is exactly what we want in a concealer. With its medium coverage and a 16-hour wear time, it feels slightly thick on skin, but that also means it remains in place without sliding or smudging. In fact, it’s so magical that we tend to completely bypass foundation while wearing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Tilbury recommends using this pick for three things: Concealing, brightening, and contouring.

Each blush features two interlaced shades — one is more of the traditional pink color you'd expect in a blush, while the other works more as a very subtle shimmery highlighter.

Some people like airy, fluttery, natural-looking lashes.

We love that it comes in 15 shades, including the iconic Pillow Talk, a pink nude, that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spawned its own collection of products</a>.
