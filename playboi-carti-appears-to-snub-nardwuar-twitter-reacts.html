Overall, this is because of the raw energy he provides to them. Whenever you go to a Carti show, you know that it is going to be one massive party. Although this energy may not be for everyone, it has certainly proven to be a hit amongst those who care. On Sunday, he brought that energy to the Summer Smash stage.</p><p>As we already reported, Playboi Carti was <a href=# rel>chased down by some fans</a>. While driving away from the show, fans took to the streets to chase Carti. As unsafe as this was, the artist have fans a glimpse of himself as he stood up and towered above the sunroof. For many fans, this was a truly incredible experience. However, as it turns out, just moments prior, Carti snubbed one of music's greatest personalities. Yes, that's right, <a href=# rel>we are talking about Nardwuar</a>.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Iggy Azalea Shares Plans To Bring Playboi Carti’s Son Onyx To Drag Shows In Response To Twitter Homophobes</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-playboi-carti-says-no>Playboi Carti Says No</h2></span><p>In the video clip above, you can see Nardwuar present Carti with a gift from outside of his vehicle. It is clear that the beloved journalist is looking for an interview. However, Carti snubs him and the car speeds off, much to the dismay of Nardwuar. Usually, Nardwuar has all of his interviews set up ahead of time, however, he clearly wanted to do something more spontaneous here. Unfortunately for Carti, this snub has led to a whole lot of hate on Twitter. Many feel protective of Nardwuar, especially when you consider how respectful he is of hip-hop culture. He is simply a personality you are allowed to be mean to.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-twitter-reacts>Twitter Reacts</h2></span><p>In the tweets down below, you can see what people had to say about Playboi Carti. For the most part, it was not very good, with some people even calling him "wack." Needless to say, he could have avoided some issues by just doing the interview.
