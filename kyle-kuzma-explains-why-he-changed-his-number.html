While talking to reporters via NBC Sports, Kuzma explained that the reason&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">behind this change was respect for Gilbert Arenas,</a> who also wore the number zero with the Wizards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/50/35/563550_91ed9e868fed916bbcae4542fdfb5a75.jpg><p><h6>Rob Carr/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Out of respect for Gilbert Arenas… That was probably one of the biggest things," Kuzma explained. "When you think of the Washington Wizards, honestly the first person I think of, because my generation, is Gilbert Arenas, Agent Zero. Obviously, that played a big part, and having a fresh start. I just felt it was right.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Arenas is perhaps one of the best players to ever suit up for the Wizards, aside from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Michael Jordan</a>. Arenas was a superb offensive talent and to this day, he remains a highly respected former player. Needless to say, Kuzma wanted to make sure he ingratiates himself with the Wizards fanbase, and this will definitely do the trick.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
