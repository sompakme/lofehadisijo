mother?&nbsp;JaVale McGee, the basketball superstar currently making waves at the Golden State Warriors is the guy you’re looking for.&nbsp;After an abortion appointment scheduled in 48 hours, JaVale’s mother went to the house of God to seek comfort, but her religious beliefs changed her life and after listening to the preacher’s sermon on the fact that life was a precious gift from God, she changed her mind about abortion.</span></p><h2><strong><span>JaVale McGee’s Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>JaVale McGee, the basketball expert was born on January 19, 1988 in Flint Michigan.&nbsp;The African-American football player studied at Providence Christian High School and Detroit Country Day School before joining Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago.&nbsp;He has been active in basketball since college, but declared his NBA draft candidacy in 2008 after his college campaign where he performed very well.&nbsp;Prior to that, the budding basketball player was picked 18th by the Washington Wizards.&nbsp;On January 6, 2011, JaVale participated in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest and set the record as the first player in a dunk contest to use three balls at once, which earned him a place in the book of Guinness records for most basketballs.&nbsp;in a jump.</span></p><p><span>Since then, JaVale McGee has played for several teams which include;&nbsp;Washington Wizards (2008-2012).&nbsp;Denver Nuggets (2012-2015), Philadelphia 76ers (2015), Dallas Mavericks (2015-2016) and Golden State Warriors (2016 to date).&nbsp;Consecutively, in 2009 and 2010, the famous basketball player was invited to the mini-camp of the men’s national basketball team in the United States.&nbsp;He also showed interest in the Philippines basketball team.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Mom, Dad, Sister, Wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>JaVale McGee was born to George Montgomery father and Pamela McGee mother.&nbsp;His father George, who is 6ft 10in, was once selected to play for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1985 second round. Unfortunately, George was not playing for the team but JaVale’s mother, Pamela, was 6ft 3 inches, was an active basketball player at the University of Southern California, where she actively played with her twin sister Paula.&nbsp;During her active years in the game, Pamela has played for several teams which include;&nbsp;Los Angeles Sparks, Sacramento Monarch and she has played in countries like Brazil, Italy and France.&nbsp;She won an Olympic gold medal in 1984.</span></p><p><span>His mother’s move to the WNBA made JaVale McGeese stand out as the first son of a WNBA player to be drafted into the NBA.&nbsp;Imani McGee-Stafford’s younger half-sister JaVale, who is 6-foot-7, is also active in the WNBA for the Atlanta Dream Team.&nbsp;When Pamela was pregnant with her son, JaVale, she nearly had an abortion as her father was no longer a part of her life, but she changed her mind after listening to a preacher’s sermon that life was a precious gift.</span></p><p><span>On that fateful day when JaVale McGee was successfully drafted by the Wizards in the NBA’s first round of drafting in 2008, Pamela could only rejoice at his decision not to have an abortion while pregnant with him.&nbsp;Since then, Pamela has been the mainstay of JaVale, guiding her career as a financial manager.&nbsp;According to Pamela, JaVale is her greatest blessing and achievement.</span></p><p><span>Married life did not favor Pamela as she found herself locked in a high profile battle against her husband of two years – Kevinendord Stafford, whom she had just divorced.&nbsp;The bitter custody battle involved Imani, JaVale’s half-sister.&nbsp;Pamela’s ex-husband was of the opinion that in the exercise of her profession, Pamela embarked on many journeys which would not allow her to properly care for their daughter.&nbsp;The courts then awarded custody to Kelvin.&nbsp;start from nothing.</span></p><p><span>Pamela was diagnosed with cancer in the past but in 2000 she managed to win the battle against breast cancer and currently she is in complete remission and according to her she does not want to tell how long she has been battling against cancer, she’s healthy now and that’s all that matters.&nbsp;Currently, she is concerned about her son’s future and life after basketball.</span></p><p><span>In addition to her profession, JaVale McGee has her own family.&nbsp;He and his beautiful girlfriend, Giselle Ramirez, have already welcomed their first child into the world.&nbsp;JaVale’s baby mama is in real estate and it was through her job that she met JaVale.&nbsp;In the LA Times, it was reported that Marc Anthony’s home, which sold for $2.425 million, was purchased by JaVale and that Giselle was the real estate agent representing the buyer in the sale.&nbsp;Giselle studied at the University of California at Los Angeles where she obtained two degrees.</span></p><p><span>At the moment, the basketball champion does not have a wife, he still has to marry his girlfriend.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Size weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>The basketball superstar stands at a height of 7ft or 2.13m and has a bodyweight of 114kg or 251.33lbs to go with the daunting height.&nbsp;According to records, of all current NBA players, JaVale had the highest documented arm span recorded at 7ft 6.5in or 2.30m until Rudy Gobert was brought into the Nuggets with a arm’s length wider than 7 feet the 2013 NBA draft.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Professional basketball has a handsome net worth of $14 million and his annual salary is tagged at $1,471,382.&nbsp;His net salary and the contract he has signed with several clubs he has played for in the past has given him an admirable net worth.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiikauurbGMppqgnZViurC5jLCgn51dqLa0wMSrZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nHnqCgoKRixKa1xqGrZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aamaR8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-iyke-i-m-still-committed-to-divorce-nigerian-actor-us-lady-carllie-taggett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Iyke: &amp;quot;Im still Committed to Divorce Nigerian Actor&amp;quot;
