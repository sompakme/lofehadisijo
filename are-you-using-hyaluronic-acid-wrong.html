Where does it get all the water it holds? Do you even want that much water on your face?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that it's everywhere and in everything–are we all guilty of misusing hyaluronic acid?</p><img alt="what is hyaluronic acid" title="what is hyaluronic acid" width=1080 height=878 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-1593447547.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hyaluronic acid is lots of things. It’s a glycosaminoglycan—somewhat unfortunately known as a GAG—found in the extracellular matrix of almost every cell in your body. It’s a linear polysaccharide. “It‘s a carbohydrate polymer made up of repeating sugar units bound together,” as Aimee Paik, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist with personalized skin care consultation platform <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.apostrophe.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Apostrophe class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Apostrophe</u></a>, tells BAZAAR. Basically, it’s a sugary carb.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hyaluronic acid also has lots of names. In its naturally occurring form, inside the body, it was originally known as “hyaluronan,” later renamed “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/hyaluronic-acid data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>hyaluronic acid</u></a>.” The synthesized stuff in skincare products is usually “hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid” or sometimes “sodium hyaluronate” (the salt derived from hyaluronic acid). Since the ingredient has all but taken over the beauty space, “hyaluronic acid” or “HA” is used as an umbrella term for any and all types: natural, topical, injectable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the use of the word “acid,” hyaluronic acid is not an exfoliator. The kind your body naturally produces is a humectant, a healer, a protector, and a plump-er. It controls the water content of the skin—where half the water in your body resides—making skin appear youthful and firm and protecting cells from premature aging. (HA is also found in the eyes and joints.) “You can kind of think of it like a sponge, it soaks up water wherever it is,” says Paik. And yes, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18472055-hyaluronan-in-skin-aspects-of-aging-and-its-pharmacologic-modulation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body’s own HA " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>body’s own HA </u></a>can apparently hold anywhere from 1,000 to 6,000 times its weight in water… but it can only get that water if you drink it or eat water-rich foods.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The majority of the skin’s HA is concentrated in the dermis (the lower layer of the skin), with less in the epidermis (the upper layer of skin), and even less in the stratum corneum (the skin barrier). In fact, hyaluronic acid is only abundant on the skin’s surface in the event of a wound-healing response. “Say you get cut, hyaluronic acid comes and sets off an inflammatory cascade that sends immune cells into the wound that allow repair to occur,” the dermatologist explains. “In its native form, it’s a big molecule, and it’s actually anti-inflammatory.” In other words, HA swoops in to save your skin.</p><img alt="what is hyaluronic acid" title="what is hyaluronic acid" width=1080 height=706 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2-1593447596.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All that hydrating, healing, protecting, and plumping sounds lovely. It only makes sense that you would want to add more of it. That’s just not how skincare works.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Think of it this way: You can’t replenish lost collagen stores by pushing collagen into your face or fortify weak bones with a bit of calcium cream. It’s the same with HA.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Why? Well, for one, hyaluronic acid has a “high molecular weight” in its natural state, making it too large to actually sink into the skin. Cosmetic chemists often hydrolyze or fragment lab-created HA into “low molecular weight” particles to aid in penetration, but these smaller versions can’t make it past the epidermis, either. (“This is why we have the world of injectable hyaluronic acid fillers,” Dr. Greg Altman, a cosmetic chemist and formulator for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://silktherapeutics.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Silk Therapeutics" data-vars-ga-product-id=d9c5df62-ce2f-477c-8da7-90c080d5f0a8 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://silktherapeutics.com/ data-product-url=https://silktherapeutics.com/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=72f9de9c-d09c-40b8-adec-0fd1d5e4a494 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>Silk Therapeutics</u></a>, points out.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two, the hyaluronic acid in skincare is not the same as the hyaluronic acid that naturally occurs in your body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You’ll be happy to know the HA in over-the-counter and prescription products is not harvested from actual humans (although it was sourced from umbilical cords back in the day). More recently, though, “HA is usually derived from bacterial or microbial fermentation,” Altman tells BAZAAR.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That’s fine, safe, and vegan. The real issue is that much of what we think we know about Hyaluronic Acid: The Skincare Ingredient is based on what we know about Hyaluronic Acid: The Substance In Cells.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bodily substance is concentrated in the lower layers of the skin; the skincare ingredient sits on top. The bodily substance has a high molecular weight; the skincare ingredient often has a low or very low molecular weight. The bodily substance sources water from your diet; there appears to be no hard data on where the skincare ingredient sources water from. The bodily substance is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18472055-hyaluronan-in-skin-aspects-of-aging-and-its-pharmacologic-modulation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="thought to bind 1,000 times its weight in water" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>thought to bind 1,000 times its weight in water</u></a>; there don’t seem to be any available studies that show the skincare ingredient attracts that amount.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">None of the chemists or dermatologists BAZAAR consulted could provide data demonstrating that lab-created, cosmetic-grade HA actually holds 1,000 times its weight in water, although plenty of studies do point to its “significant” water-drawing capabilities. Chemical manufacturer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stanfordchem.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stanford Chemicals Company" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Stanford Chemicals Company</u></a> states that “topical hyaluronic acid has limited ability to retain water.” A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/consumer-claims-over-peter-thomas-roths-alleged-false-advertising-of-skincare-products-to-go-ahead data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="class-action lawsuit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>class-action lawsuit</u></a> recently filed against Peter Thomas Roth alleges the beauty brand falsely advertised its line of hyaluronic acid products by saying the ingredient “will draw moisture from the atmosphere into the user’s skin” and “will hold 1,000 times its weight in water.” With a dearth of research on the subject, a judge has ordered an “in-court demonstration in which a certain amount of hyaluronic acid is placed in a beaker, one thousand times that weight in water is placed in another beaker, and the contents are combined, all watching to see if all the water will be absorbed.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although Paik supports the use of HA in general, the dermatologist admits that “smaller HA molecules set inflammation in motion,” referencing the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.woundsresearch.com/article/hyaluronic-acid-inflammation-and-tissue-regeneration data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="many, many studies" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>many, many studies</u></a> that show low molecular weight hyaluronic acid has a pro-inflammatory effect on the skin. “Our bodies are so complicated we don’t quite understand all the signaling that occurs,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best available science points to the fact that low molecular weight HA is “able to bind to TLR receptors and consequently initiate the signaling cascade, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various types of cells,” as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.woundsresearch.com/article/hyaluronic-acid-inflammation-and-tissue-regeneration data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one study" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>one study</u></a> says.

atmosphere and draws it into your skin…but there appears to be no research that proves HA sources water from the environment. “There’s really not a lot of water in the air, even if you lived in a steam room,” Wendy Ouriel, a cellular biologist and founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.oumere.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItaOK673O5wIVS5yzCh1j8w2HEAAYASAAEgJ2MPD_BwE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Oumere class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Oumere</u></a>, tells BAZAAR. (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sciencing.com/percentage-water-vapor-atmosphere-19385.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies confirm" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Studies confirm</u></a> that water vapor content ranges from 0.2 percent to 4 percent.) Finding the atmosphere lacking, “hyaluronic acid is going to pull directly from which it’s attached,” Ouriel says: your skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s just a basic principle of biology,” the biologist explains. “It’s going to go to the nearest source.” Even in the most humid, tropical, 4-percent-water-vapor conditions, hyaluronic acid will theoretically resort to slurping up the moisture that sits within your skin—and within your own hyaluronic acid stores—and pulling it to the surface. This will temporarily make the skin appear hydrated and smooth, but moisture on the surface evaporates (perhaps why the skin’s innate wisdom prioritizes lower-level moisture), thereby dehydrating the skin (perhaps motivating you to apply more hyaluronic acid, compounding the effect).</p><img alt="Face, Skin, Chin, Head, Nose, Cheek, Beauty, Forehead, Lip, Illustration, " title="Face, Skin, Chin, Head, Nose, Cheek, Beauty, Forehead, Lip, Illustration, " width=1080 height=1300 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/internalimage-1583263389.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Design by Ingrid Frahm,</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You know when your lips are really chapped and you lick your lips and it feels better for a second, but then 10 minutes later, it’s drier? It’s the same thing,” Ouriel offers. Science supports this: A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6490993/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2018 study" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>2018 study</u></a> funded by Estée Lauder found that, in humid environments, topical HA "created a false increase in apparent water content exacerbating water loss rate;” meaning, it made skin look hydrated by pulling moisture to the surface, but actually led to dehydration. A 2016 study found that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (also known as short-chain HA)<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://europepmc.org/article/med/27050698 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" increased water loss" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u> increased water loss</u></a> by over 55 percent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, HA devotees claim you can circumvent this effect by applying the ingredient to damp skin, or by following up with a water-based moisturizer. “Then you’re negating everything,” she counters. “Because it’s just going to absorb the water on your skin, and it’s not going to go into your skin, so what’s the whole point of it?” Eventually, that surface-level water evaporates, leaving no long-term benefit behind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Hyaluronic acid is often considered by many as a moisturizer, but in reality, it should strictly be considered a ‘plumper,’” confirms board-certified dermatologist Sheerene Idriss.</p><img alt="what is hyaluronic acid" title="what is hyaluronic acid" width=1080 height=941 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5-1593447706.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That’s not to say HA should be banished to the back of the beauty cabinet, says LeRoux. “I was totally anti-hyaluronic acid, but I’ve been researching this for about a year,” the formulator tells BAZAAR. In that time, she believes she’s cracked the code on non-irritating HA: very small amounts of high-quality, high molecular weight HA. “You can’t use it in too many products, or it will start to draw water from the skin,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Not everyone is going to react to HA,” Schook acknowledges, noting that sun exposure, chemical exposure, and the immune system may all play a role in an individual’s response to HA. The aesthetician adds that those with oily skin could have better reactions to hyaluronic acid overall, since oil inhibits one of HA's supposed long-term side effects: microbiome disruption and inflammation (more on that below).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what about all the hyaluronic acid devotees that swear the ingredient has saved their skin, I ask? To which Ouriel replies, “You can’t determine what ingredient is benefiting your skin unless you eliminate all the other ingredients, and in skincare, you have at least 30 other ingredients [in one routine].”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paik takes the same-but-opposite approach, pointing out that it’s equally as difficult to determine what ingredient is irritating your skin. “People are using so many things on their skin, and you can blame anything,” she says.</p><img alt="what is hyaluronic acid" title="what is hyaluronic acid" width=1080 height=759 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6-1593447737.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Considering the well-researched relationship between LMW and inflammation, some say high molecular weight, or long-chain hyaluronic acid (HMW HA) is the way to go. But according to Schook, even HMW HA presents a problem.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She points to evidence that all hyaluronic acid may feed a type of fungus that is naturally present on the skin’s surface: microorganisms on the microbiome called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4109575/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dermatophytes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>dermatophytes</u></a>. “We have fungi that lives on our skin that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132899/?report=printable" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="thrives on sugar" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>thrives on sugar</u></a>, and HA is a sugar,” says Schook. “Once the fungi <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nailsmag.com/392846/debunking-the-fungus-myth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ingest the sugar" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>ingest the sugar</u></a>, they secrete an enzyme that breaks down our skin's barrier that allows bacteria and viruses to invade, creating inflammation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The formulator explains that “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/skin-disorders/fungal-skin-infections/overview-of-fungal-skin-infections data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the wetter the skin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the wetter the skin</u></a>, the easier the invasion for the dermatophyte,” and any hyaluronic acid of any molecular weight essentially holds water on the skin’s surface. “In the world of wound healing, when you keep the skin wet too long, it is called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_maceration data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=maceration class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>maceration</u></a>,” she says. “Maceration causes bacteria and viruses to invade, thus inflammation.” (True, other humectants create “wet” skin, too, like glycerin. But “glycerin acts as a natural antifungal,” Schook explains, negating that whole fungus-feeding thing.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s worth noting that although HMW HA is anti-inflammatory, it still triggers an immune response when applied topically. The skin essentially recognizes it as part of the body’s natural <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.intechopen.com/books/wound-healing-current-perspectives/the-strategies-of-natural-polysaccharide-in-wound-healing data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wound-healing mechanism" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>wound-healing mechanism</u></a> and gets to work. It can be useful in the “setting of acute wounds to initiate healing,” says Paik.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I see many patients who are overusing it in multiple steps of their skincare regimen, and this is ultimately leading to dehydration,” confirms Idriss. “I recommend limiting its use to every once in a while if you want a plumping effect, but if you can’t part ways with your daily HA, then stick to having it in only one step (or product) of your routine."<br></p><img alt="what is hyaluronic acid" title="what is hyaluronic acid" width=1080 height=894 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/7-1593447761.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, you could always boost your body’s own supply. “My take is, why put hyaluronic acid in your skincare in the hope that maybe you’ll get the hydration?” says Ouriel. “Why not just have your body make its own hyaluronic acid, and preserve the hyaluronic acid that your body already makes?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The main way to make more hyaluronic acid is to increase cellular turnover, since each new cell begets a new extracellular matrix, complete with its own HA. “Use AHA, BHA, and PHA exfoliation to stimulate your body to make more naturally, which can be done indefinitely,” the biologist recommends. (Daily <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a27229712/gua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gua sha facial massage" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>gua sha facial massage</u></a> stimulates cellular turnover, too, without all the exfoliation.) You can also get hyaluronic acid via food, like sweet potatoes and bone broth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finally, help the hyaluronic acid you already have by giving it more moisture to hoard. Chug a glass of water (or eight). Snack on water-rich veggies like celery and cucumber. Your naturally-occurring HA—the real “miracle ingredient,” heavy with hydration and snuggled deep within your dermis—will thank you.</p><img alt="Circle, Silver, Transparent material, Still life photography, Kitchen utensil, Drawing, " title="Circle, Silver, Transparent material, Still life photography, Kitchen utensil, Drawing, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bumper-1583264231.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/3c1a440e-79d9-4046-8cc0-89f51bb7f2d2_1593714291.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Jessica DeFino" title="Headshot of Jessica DeFino" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jessica DeFino is a beauty reporter covering natural, holistic, sustainable skincare.
