During episode 3 of her Audible podcast Michelle Obama: The Light Podcast (available for streaming tomorrow), the former first lady is joined by comedian and late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien to discuss inclusive representation for young women — something she feels she didn't have growing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We've got so many&nbsp;role models. We've got Serena now out there," she said in the episode, which was recorded in front of a live audience. "I didn't have a Serena to look up to, somebody who was beautiful, strong, fast, outspoken.

"I write about Mindy Kaling now rewriting the whole story of who belongs in television," she continued. "Ali Wong, who's one of my favorite comedians. All of those women, their representation is so important.

She shares that being a representative for Black girls everywhere encouraged her to be vocal about her journey and experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Why do I write these books? I have thoughts in my head, but I think the more stories that I can tell about a little black girl from the South Side of Chicago who is working class, there's going to be some kid out there that's going to see themselves in the way that I didn't have somebody to see," she explained. "And it is important for us to put our stories out there."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Audible</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She spotted a young audience member and addressed her personally, telling her to have confidence in herself and her story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want little girls like this little beautiful girl right there, yes you, yes you, to know that your story matters, that I see you with hair like mine and that beautiful smile, and you belong.

During the book tour, Obama invited many of her famous friends, including O'Brien, Ellen DeGeneres, Tyler Perry,&nbsp;Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Hoda Kotb, and more to join her on stages around the country to record the podcast and have vital conversations in front of intimate crowds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Like so many people around the world, I felt isolated, disconnected, and discouraged during the pandemic. Writing&nbsp;The Light We Carry&nbsp;was a way for me to make sense of it and reflect on some of the biggest challenges we all face in life — and the tour was an incredible way to share those stories with my readers and connect with real people once again," Obama said in a press release at the time. "The best part is that this time around I got to bring some of my best friends and favorite personalities to join in the fun. That’s what&nbsp;Michelle Obama: The Light Podcast&nbsp;is all about — it’s a deeper examination of those fun and meaningful moments, lovingly made by our incredible team at Higher Ground and the fantastic people at Audible. I can’t wait for you all to take a listen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKaoZ2cobJuu8GapJplpJ2ybrjIoJ%2BtZaCksaSt0q1ksKedmrtuvs6lnGaln5myrb%2BMcGpvb2lpfQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-robinson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Robinson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-you-make-a-queen-bed-look-like-a-couch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How do you make a queen bed look like a couch?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
