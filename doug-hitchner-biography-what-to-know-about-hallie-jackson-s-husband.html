correspondent for National Broadcasting Company (NBC) news.&nbsp;More so, she is an anchor for several news shows on MSNBC and has worked with several news agencies.&nbsp;Despite all his fame, Doug Hitchner who is her husband has managed to keep his profile very low over the years to such an extent that not much is known about him.</span></p><p><span>That said, he is a former college baseball player, American baseball coach, and part-time fighter who rose to popularity after marrying the popular reporter.&nbsp;Known for being an extremely private person, here are some interesting facts you might like to know about Hitchner.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Doug Hitchner</span></strong></h2><p><span>Douglas Hitchner, popularly known as DougHitchner was born in the United States.&nbsp;Some believe that the date of his birth is March 10, 1983, but there is still no confirmation on this.&nbsp;For someone who maintains a very quiet life, it’s unclear how he was raised or even anything about his family.</span></p><p><span>After completing with his high school education, he went to Johns Hopkins University.&nbsp;Thanks to his baseball skills, he joined the university team and even had the opportunity to play for the university in various competitions.&nbsp;Although many would have thought he would make a career out of the sport he loved as a player, Doug Hitchner didn’t go that route.</span></p><p><span>He later became a member of his university’s baseball coaching staff upon graduation.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life and wife (Hallie Jackson)</span></strong></h2><p><span>When Doug was in college, he met a young woman named Hallie Jackson who was studying political science.&nbsp;Soon after they met, the two started dating and eventually in 2011 they became man and wife.&nbsp;Although he dated a popular personality like Jackson, the couple still managed to go unnoticed by the media or even the public.</span></p><p><span>After dating for a while, Doug proposed to his better half in 2010. A year later, they got married in Perkasie, Pennsylvania in Bucks County.&nbsp;As you’d expect from a notoriously private couple, they had a very private wedding ceremony that few people knew about.&nbsp;In fact, only close friends and family members of the duo honored the union.&nbsp;Moreover, it was so exclusive that only a few photos from the wedding can be found on the Internet.</span></p><p><span>The couple are now proud parents of two daughters.&nbsp;Being private persons, the names of the two girls are unknown, as is their date of birth.&nbsp;We know, however, that the family lives together in New York.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Like most other things about Doug Hitchner, his exact net worth is not known.&nbsp;His wife, on the other hand, is said to be worth around $1 million as she earns over $210,000 a year in salary.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other interesting facts about Doug Hitchner</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span>Doug is a very private person and is apparently good at it.&nbsp;He was able to stay away from media life despite his marriage to a popular television journalist.</span></li><li><span>His wife, Hallie Marie Jackson has been a journalist since 2006 when she joined WBOC-TV.&nbsp;Born in 1984 and raised in Yardley, Pennsylvania, she attended Pennsbury High School before heading to Johns Hopkins University where she met her future husband, Hitchner.</span></li><li><span>Doug Hitchner was a very good baseball player and this earned him a job on the college coaching staff after graduation.&nbsp;He was a good player at Johns Hopkins University as he was considered an outstanding blocker and receiver during his time with the varsity team.</span></li><li><span>He only appears occasionally on Hallie’s social media pages, but neither of their daughters have appeared on Hallie’s social media pages.</span></li><li><span>Hitcher is a part-time hunter, and he’s good at it, too.&nbsp;His Instagram account shows that he hunts various animals ranging from ducks to deer.</span></li><li><span>He enjoys participating in various fishing events and has won several awards there.</span></li><li><span>Doug’s wife has been a senior White House correspondent for the network since early 2017. However, she also anchors for MSNBC.</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGicn6q0brTIrZqhppWneqO1zmauoZmkYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMoZilpJmaequtwqSqqKajYrW2v8GapZ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-fanning-joined-zo%C3%AB-kravitz-in-embracing-this-quintessential-summer-shoe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elle Fanning Joined Zo Kravitz in Embracing This Quintessential Summer Shoe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-wows-in-little-black-dress-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Catherine Zeta-Jones wows in little black dress photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
