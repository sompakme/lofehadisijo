Lancaster, <a href=#>California</a>, was shaken up in August 1997 following the death of 21-year-old Ricky Cowles Jr., an electrician who worked at his family's business.</p><p>He was found <a href=#>shot in the head</a> on April 12, 1997, in his apartment about a month after he moved in with his girlfriend, Amy Preasmyer, who was 15 weeks pregnant, and their mutual friend, Jennifer Kellogg.</p><p>At the time, it was Preasmyer who discovered the body, according to <a aria-label="TheCinemaholic (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TheCinemaholic</a>.</p><p>Preasmyer immediately called the <a href=#>police</a>, who thought it could've been a robbery, however, that motive was ruled out after it was discovered that nothing had been stolen.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More from crime">Read More from crime</h2><p>There were also no signs of forced entry, which led police to suspect that it could've been an inside job, TheCinemaholic reports.</p><h2>Who killed Ricky Cowles Jr?</h2><p>During the investigation, authorities received a tip alleging that a former store clerk, William "Bill" Hoffman, had confessed to killing Cowles.</p><p>At first, authorities were stumped because they could not find a connection between the two, however, during trial, he explained that he had been solicited by Preasmyer to kill Cowles.</p><p>Authorities did not think much of Hoffman's accusations at the time, but in 2002, after he wrote a letter to Cowles' family confessing, they took a closer look at Preasmyer's role in the murder.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>“It was basically his conscience. He testified he had become a Christian and how he was gravely remorseful for what he had done and was trying to make it right as best he could,” Deputy District Attorney Michael&nbsp;Blake said of the letter, via <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Daily News</a>.</p><p>In 2007, Preasmyer was then found guilty of soliciting Hoffman for the murder.</p><p>Prosecutors said that Preasmyer did it because Cowles had gotten her <a href=#>pregnant</a> and "ruined her life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/AS_RICKY-COWLES_COMP-NEW.jpg><p>“She had reached a point, I believe, where in her own words, she blamed the victim for the pregnancy and basically told other people he had ruined her birthday and ruined her life,” Blake said.</p><p>“There was other evidence she despised the victim. By August 1997, she is actively looking for someone to kill him.”</p><h2>Where are Amy and Bill now?</h2><p>Hoffman was convicted of murder in 1999 and then sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 10 years, according to <a href=# aria-label="Los Angeles Daily News (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Daily News</a>.</p><p>Preasmyer was also sentenced to life in prison without parole, however, the Central California Women's Facility's website has an eligible parole date for her listed as March 2029, according to <a aria-label="Distractify (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>.</p><p>The outlet spoke with the public information officer from the facility who said that she could've been granted clemency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdoZYJxg5FqZrCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRiv6qvyrJknKenobK0ecmrZJ2ZpJq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-keeley-hawes-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-crossfire-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Keeley Hawes?
