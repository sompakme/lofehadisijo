God can always flip the script."</p><p>Earlier this week Khloe shared a glam photo of her in a knitted crop top, which she teamed with high-waisted pants, but it wasn't the outfit fans were looking at.</p><p>Soon enough fans spotted that&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe</a>'s right arm appeared to go in at the elbow and then back out in an unusually warped way.</p><p>One wrote on the photo: "No-one else going to mention that arm? Look at the curve!"</p><h2>'SO PHOTOSHOPPED'</h2><p>Another agreed: "So photoshopped."</p><p>She posed in the revealing number while promoting fast-fashion brand Shein, despite previously being&nbsp;<a href=#>slammed for supporting the "unethical" company</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Khloe and baby daddy Tristan Thompson, 30, share three-year-old daughter, True, and have been amicably coparenting the little one after once again ending their relationship in the spring.</p><h2>RECONCILIATION RUMORS</h2><p>However, a recent report by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a> claimed that Khloe and Tristan are back on.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;alum apparently forgave the basketball player after he had "promised" to do better the third time around.</p><p>The source claimed: “It may not be the most ideal situation because of her trust issues, but she’s desperate to make it work and he’s once again promised to do better.</p><p>“Khloé wants Tristan in True’s life and she’s still holding out hope for that second child. They are far from over.”</p><p>A second insider contributed: “He also promised Khloé that things will be different this time around and that he signed with the Sacramento Kings to be closer to her and True, and be a proper family and she believes him.”</p><p>However, sources told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>, they are not back together.</p><h2>'SHE WANTS HIM AROUND'</h2><p>Insiders shared: "She wants him around and they talk every day. Khloe has forgiven him for what he's done and would rather just be on good terms with him."</p><p>Other sources added: "They have a healthy co-parenting relationship where they put their daughter first...</p><p>"It's very important to Khloe that True has a relationship with her dad and that her parents get along.
