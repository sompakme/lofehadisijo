Simply take the thermostat straight out and you’ll see the AAA batteries on the back, which you can replace with new ones. Batteries should be replaced once a year, according to industry standards.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Furthermore, do all Trane thermostats come equipped with batteries?</h3><p>Not all thermostats are battery-operated; many are hardwired into the home’s electrical distribution system. If you have a thermostat that is powered by batteries, you may try removing the front plate from the wall plate and changing the batteries to see if this brings the thermostat back to life. If not, you can try replacing the batteries with new ones.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, what is the cause of my Trane thermostat being blank?</h3><p>This is often caused by a lack of ventilation in the HVAC system, which may be caused by malfunctioning or unclean components. A failed fan motor might cause your electrical components to draw more current than they should, resulting in the high-limit switch being tripped.
