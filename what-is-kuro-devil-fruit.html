Being totally shocked, Mahiru is unable to move.<h2>How did Luffy beat Kuro?</h2>Kuro yells that his plan will never fail but he is cut off by a second head butt by Luffy.

It was eaten by Domino.<h2>What is Cobys power?</h2>Due to his harsh training regime under Garp as well as further training after two years, Koby possesses immense physical strength and speed.

[ just like what happened to Jack when Zunisha drowned his fleet.]<h2>Can a Devil Fruit user swim in freshwater?</h2>Fresh or salt water, it doesn't matter, it still drains a devil fruit user of their strength as long as it's ankle deep. We've seen Luffy and others exposed to fresh water and still be unable to swim.<h2>Who is Kirin Kusogawa?</h2>Kusogawa Kirin is originally a character created for a fan made Naruto-based RP on the online community site GaiaOnline in 2005.
