That being said, McMahon made sure to get his way no matter what, as he is officially back in WWE as Member Of the Board. It was said that <a href=#>McMahon planned on returning to the company in a bid to sell it</a>. Now it seems WWE could be gearing towards a potential sale, as the company has now hired JPMorgan to lead sale talks.</p><p>As fans have been made aware since yesterday, there is nothing Vince McMahon cannot accomplish,&nbsp;<a href=#>as McMahon was officially reinstated to the Board Of Directors</a>. Despite his return, that doesn’t necessarily mean&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE’s sale is guarantee</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the topic of WWE getting sold has never been more relevant than it is now. According to a report by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Sherman of CNBC</a>, the company has hired JP Morgan to give advice on sale talks.</p><p>“WWE has hired JPMorgan to help the company advise on a potential sale. If a deal occurs, it would likely occur in the next three to six months, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. WWE plans to talk to potential buyers before it makes a decision on TV rights renewal agreements.”</p><p>It was further noted that there are three categories of likely buyers for WWE: legacy media companies, streamers, and entertainment holding companies. The article named Comcast (NBCU’s parent company), Netflix, Amazon, Endeavor Group Holdings (UFC’s parent company), Warner Bros. Discovery (TNT & TBS’ parent company), Disney, and FOX as potential buyers for the time being.</p><p>Even Eric Bischoff believes <a href=#>Vince McMahon returned to WWE to aggressively pursue sale</a>. Vince McMahon previously gave full support to&nbsp;<a href=#>Triple H and WWE management before he returned</a>. We will have to wait and see whether WWE will end up being sold in the near future.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on WWE’s potential sale?
