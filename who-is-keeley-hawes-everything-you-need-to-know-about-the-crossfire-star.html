Speaking about growing up in the capital, Keeley told <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a></strong>: "Just the idea of your children going out and playing out and coming in when it's dark, that just doesn't happen.

You're singing away and doing things that give you confidence."</p><h2>Keeley Hawes's husband Matthew Macfadyen and children</h2><p id=ec9KZoD-f3Wb data-wc=65>Keeley has three children of her own – a son Myles, 22, with her first husband, DJ and cartoonist Spencer McCallum, and a son Ralph, 16, and a daughter Maggie, 17, with her current husband Matthew Macfadyen.

The pair married in front of just two witnesses, their friends, at a local registry. Keeley has since told : "I love being married to Matthew. And I know Matthew loves being married, too. It ties everything up and it's a statement to each other and to the world. Marriage and being a mother are absolutely crucial to my happiness and my life."</p><p id=eD0tR5popj9e data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Matthew Macfadyen and Keeley Hawes to play husband and wife in new ITV drama</a></strong></p><p id=ee_AtI1jpZd0 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Who is Finding Alice star Keeley Hawes' husband Matthew Macfadyen?" class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about Keeley Hawes and Matthew Macfadyen's relationship</a></strong></p><p id=ewupzefnzIC3 data-wc=112>Her decision to end her first marriage "was just horrible" and "awful", she recalled, but Keeley has since remained on good terms with her ex-husband Spencer, calling him "one of my best friends in the world". Keeley revealed that Spencer and his girlfriend even babysit for her. "<strong>They are just really wonderful, generous human beings who, ultimately, have always put my son and my other children first.</strong> And I can't thank them enough, really," she told magazine, adding: "Divorce doesn't have to be messy. I think as long as people concentrate on the children above themselves – which is difficult, I know – maybe that's the way to make it work."</p><h2>Keeley Hawes's role in The Durrells</h2><p id=eiIEiBk8agdj data-wc=32>In comedy-drama , Keeley played&nbsp;Louisa Durrell, mother to Gerry, Leslie, Margo and Larry.
