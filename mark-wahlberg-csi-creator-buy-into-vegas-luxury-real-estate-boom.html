We started to see people make lifestyle changes and really take a look at what their living situation was. And we started to see this influx of buyers from California, and it was just absolutely crazy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The craze for luxury homes continues. <a href=# id=auto-tag_las-vegas_1 data-tag=las-vegas>Las Vegas</a> recorded its highest number of $1&nbsp;million-plus sales in the first quarter of 2023, though median home sale prices have declined recently to around $415,000, after peaking in 2022 at $482,000. (In contrast, the current median sales price for a home in Los Angeles is around $980,000.)</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It’s no longer just a place for Strip regulars like Wayne Newton and Donny and Marie Osmond; a new pack of power players led by <a href=# id=auto-tag_mark-wahlberg_1 data-tag=mark-wahlberg>Mark Wahlberg</a> are relocating to Las Vegas, the land of no individual state income tax and lower-cost living. Nevada also has one of the country’s lowest property tax rates, at 0.55 percent, per Business Insider.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Last year, Wahlberg sold his 20-bedroom mansion in Beverly Park for $55&nbsp;million and bought into the exclusive Summit Club in the Summerlin community, where he purchased a $14.5&nbsp;million townhome and has also acquired a $15.6 million 2.5-acre lot. Wahlberg is also planning to build a production studio in the city. In March, he told Fox News it was “absolutely” his goal to turn Vegas into an entertainment industry center: “We’re looking to create 10,000 jobs in the studio alone. We want to train people both in front of and behind the camera, create jobs, most importantly, first and foremost, for locals … And then, after that, I think we can attract a lot of people. The housing market is great.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He’s also said</a> that his family loves living there: “The kids are really happy, and it’s all about them.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Concurs real estate agent Melissa Tomastik, of The Agency, “The value of the dollar stretches considerably farther in Las Vegas. Several of our clients have expressed that their real estate investment in Las Vegas equates to what they would have otherwise allocated toward taxes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Print-Painted-Feather-64.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Print-7-Painted-Feather-7-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">CSI creator Anthony Zuiker — who grew up in Las Vegas and recently purchased a $6 million home in the suburb of Henderson — has seen the town go from a mob hangout to a first-class city. “We’re into the next level of professional sports, the A’s baseball, the Raiders, some really high-end, <a href=#>$2 billion Sphere</a>, hotels, Resorts World,” he tells THR. “It’s definitely gone into a more fashion-forward direction.” The city will also welcome the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix</a> in November and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">host the 2024 Super Bowl</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Some are buying because they have soured on California. Earlier this year, outspoken conservative Superman actor Dean Cain (who has said he opposes California’s fiscal, crime and homelessness policies) purchased a $3.9&nbsp;million, five-bedroom modern contemporary in a gated community in Henderson. And venture capitalist Marc Andreessen — while continuing to own a record-breaking $177&nbsp;million Malibu spread as well as a Tuscan-style mansion in Atherton, California — purchased a $36.2&nbsp;million, 4.47-acre lot in The Summit Club in 2021. Last year, he tweeted, “Like Rome in maybe 250 A.D., we live amidst an enormous flowering of culture and creativity, but the roads are becoming unsafe and nobody is quite sure why.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Other recent celeb real estate deals include Celine Dion’s sale in May of an estate in The Summit Club for $30&nbsp;million (she still owns a $5&nbsp;million home in Lake Las Vegas) and Oscar De La Hoya’s purchase of a $14.5&nbsp;million mansion in Henderson in 2022.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Developers are doubling down on the new Vegas cachet. Gated communities like The Summit Club, MacDonald Highlands, The Ridges and Ascaya offer the luxury and security of Los Angeles without the sticker shock. “It feels like Las Vegas is just getting started from a growth perspective. Because of the influx of people we’ve had from other states, the luxury market has been continuously growing,” says agent Ivan Sher of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>IS Luxury,</a> adding that, “We have a new playing field of sophistication and architecture and design.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VGP_018_original.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Four Seasons brand has also bought into the trend, with the Four Seasons Private Residences set to open in early 2026. And it seems that bet is paying off — of the 176 residences, which start at $3.5&nbsp;million and go up to $29&nbsp;million, 48 are already under contract, exceeding expectations.&nbsp;A home in The Summit Club is currently on the market for $23.5 million; listed with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Coldwell Banker’s Lillie Shines</a>, the 9,800-square-foot house features nine bedrooms (five in a private, attached casita) and an outdoor kitchen with pizza oven and bar on a parcel of just over one acre.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For decades, Las Vegas was where Zuiker escaped on the weekends, after spending his week working in Los Angeles. But now he’s living and working in Vegas full time, flying into Southern California for events. “I think things have flipped,” Zuiker says, “in terms of where we’re working and where we’re spending our weekends.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A version of this story first appeared in the Sept. 20 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvRnpilZZWowaLAxGikmqqbYsSitMubnKufXZjAqnnCq5yarJ%2BnerexxpqqZqSlrcKzxYyrnJqkXZrAta3TnmSbp5%2BienJ%2Bkm5scmxjaX5w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./murda-mook-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Murda Mook Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marin-hopper-daughter-of-dennis-debuts-design-corner-at-bergdorf-goodman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marin Hopper (Daughter of Dennis) Debuts Design Corner at Bergdorf Goodman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
