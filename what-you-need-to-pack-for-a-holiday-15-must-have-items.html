"<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Packing cubes</a> are life," the duo declared. "They make it super easy to pack and unpack by compartmentalising your suitcase so you know exactly where everything is. You can pack in outfits or in sections eg: swimsuits, underwear. Also when it comes time to do the dreaded 'after holiday' laundry - use one for dirty, whites and one for clean - it saves huge amounts of time."</p><p id=ehzYgHqVRX data-wc=81>The pair, who have just released their first book, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">This Is Beauty. This Is Fashion. This Is Life</a>, also recommend the roll don't fold approach to packing. "This technique takes up less room in the case, so you can pack more in, and causes less creasing," they tell us. Their final tip? "Stuff your hats with your pants. This pro-stylist trick helps to hold the shape of the hat, and can be space-saving, packing into crevices you may otherwise not use."</p><h2>How we chose the best items to pack for a holiday</h2><p id=erBXbbEBBF data-wc=56>Personal experience! I've just come back from a holiday, and I stupidly forgot some key things. I want to give you a list that I wish I had. I also reached out to the <strong>HELLO!</strong> Shopping Team for their suggestions as well. Most of these items will be from Amazon because often you need next-day delivery.&nbsp;</p><h2>The essentials to pack for your trip</h2><p id=evLzvgTV2R data-wc=51><strong>Travel documents</strong> are a given. These are the items you can't afford to travel without. Make sure you have your <strong>passport and various travel documents</strong> - such as your <strong>travel insurance</strong> - safe in your hand luggage. It’s also worth making a copy before you travel in case anything goes missing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/571c48fc418f-travel-photo.jpg><p id=ejhoYVNsmS data-wc=122>Use your hand luggage to store your valuables. From the all-important<strong>&nbsp;phone and charger&nbsp;</strong>to your <strong>travel currency</strong> and <strong>camera</strong>, you're going to want to save plenty of room in your hand luggage for these valuables and entertainment. Make sure you take an <strong>appropriate plug adaptor</strong> for your destination (I forgot this one for my most recent trip - doh!), and download some of your favourite films or TV shows to your iPad or tablet to watch on the flight if you have a long journey. Picking up a<strong>&nbsp;phrase book or travel guide</strong> to the country you're visiting will prove invaluable in helping you to find your way around and impress the locals with your lingo – or at least try.</p><p id=e8MusnEbvG data-wc=41>If you're travelling with children, keep little ones comfortable and entertained on your travels with <strong>snacks, toys and games</strong>.

Make sure you take enough sun cream and<strong>&nbsp;after sun&nbsp;</strong>to see you through at least the first few days, and pack <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>bug repellent,</a> <strong>antiseptic cream</strong> and a <strong>first aid kit</strong> to keep your family happy and healthy throughout your trip.</p><p data-wc=50 id=e4x-AbUkZx9>While you can pick up many <strong>toiletries</strong> and emergency supplies close to most resorts, taking your own will give you peace of mind that you have everything you need on hand, while saving valuable time to enjoy by the pool or on the beach.<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Travel size mini products</a> are good!&nbsp;</p><p data-wc=39 id=e2qcswNPp-H>Fingers crossed everything will be perfect on your trip, but it’s important to prepare for all eventualities – from packing an <strong>umbrella</strong> or <strong>waterproof jacket&nbsp;</strong>for any sudden downpours to taking a s<strong>mall sewing kit&nbsp;</strong>for any clothing malfunctions.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

To put a stop to luggage panic, we’re big fans of adding Apple’s AirTag tracker to our suitcases, which uses Apple’s 'Find My' network and Precision Finding technology to show you exactly where your items are at any given time.</p><p>On my most recent holiday to the Maldives, I was so worried my luggage wouldn't make the connection.

If you're going away for a few days, use the packing cubes for day one, day two and day three's outfits including underwear and accessories. That way, you won't even need to rummage around to find something. If you're going away for longer, you could use packing cubes for swimwear and underwear and they're especially good when packing for the kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">European Plug Adapter with 3 USB</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0203f3d1bb5d-european-travel-adaptor.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>We've all been there - you forget the travel adaptor and have to spend three times as much on one at the airport.
