(Also, Reneé Rapp is tonight’s musical guest, so, yes.) As such, Elordi has been on the press circuit this week, and thanks to comments made on this talk show or that talk show, it sounds like—despite sometimes feeling like the opposite was true—Euphoria’s third season is actually going to happen. (The second season concluded in February 2022, nearly two full years ago, and, even still, the third season isn’t expected until 2025.)</p><p>Because of all the time that’s passed between seasons, Elordi is apparently getting concerned that he’s aging out of his role as teenager Nate Jacobs. “I hope [filming is] soon, otherwise they’re going to have to Benjamin Button me or something,” he joked on a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (and per<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1393509/why-jacob-elordi-is-worried-about-returning-for-euphoria-season-3 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>E! News</u></a>). “I’m going to have, like, a bad back walking down the hallway.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzzakQyneYTQcqsXGYS8qZ-1920-80.jpeg><p>Elordi—who, for the record, is 26—then addressed rumors that the third season will include a time jump that takes the high school-aged characters into adulthood: “I’m assuming that we’re going to have to go forward,” he said. “Otherwise, it’s going to seem like a weird bit.”</p><p>Since the show premiered in 2019, Elordi has also won acclaim in films like Saltburn and Priscilla—and some very, very famous fans, too. “The biggest one is probably Leonardo DiCaprio, which sounds like a crazy name drop,” he said. “But yeah, Leonardo DiCaprio.” He added that DiCaprio “came up to me in a club one time when I was sort of much younger. There’s really loud music and everything and he’s like, ‘Hey, the shot in the first season, you know, the show where you came in.’ And then it’s just him and I, and we’re in this club just going like…talking about camera angles.” Shocking no one, Elordi made no bones about it being a mutual admiration society, saying of DiCaprio “He’s the GOAT.”</p><p>So, as we all anxiously await season three, we can pass the time by indulging in the viral candle inspired by that bathtub scene in Saltburn. Fallon, the good interviewer that he is, handed one of the candles to Elordi to smell and—after mimicking the slurping noises of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/barry-keoghan/>Barry Keoghan</a> (watch the movie, and you’ll get it)—he said “It smells like a washing room, like detergent.” Interesting.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdkoLHnq3NSSWiF6Df95DA-1920-80.jpeg><p>And, while we can presumably expect Elordi (as well as co-stars like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/zendaya/>Zendaya</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sydney-sweeney/>Sydney Sweeney</a>) for season three of Euphoria, we won’t see Angus Cloud onscreen, as he tragically passed away last summer; Barbie Ferreira will also<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.justjared.com/2024/01/18/euphoria-season-3-cast-12-actors-expected-to-return-3-stars-wont-be-plus-hbo-execs-latest-update/10/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>not be returning</u></a> to set. “I feel like with season two and certain parts of it, I felt was a kind of a struggle for both parties,” she said on the “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard” podcast, referencing herself and showrunner Sam Levinson. “It was a struggle to find the continuation of her [Kat Hernandez, her character]. So that was actually really hurtful watching it and seeing the fans get upset.” She added “Sam writes for, like, things that he relates to. I don’t think he relates to Kat. I like Kat, so I get to go on my own path. At first, I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m a flop. I’m a loser.’ It really has been a good thing,” she said of her exit from the show.</p><p>Okay, but we’re still thinking about the time jump. Elordi’s comments seem to confirm it, but it’s not the first we’ve heard about it. The show’s costume designer Heidi Bivens told<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vogue.com/article/heidi-bivens-euphoria-fashion-book-interview referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>Vogue</u></a> that season three might take place half a decade after season two: “There is talk of it being approximately five years in the future, and that they’re not in high school anymore,” she said. “Dorothy’s not in Kansas anymore. I mean, it might be a total trip. Who can say? But knowing Sam’s brain, it’s gonna be exciting, and he will challenge all of us, because he won’t want to repeat himself. It’ll be something new for the audience to discover.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

But also with all the characters, in the sense where they’re trying to figure out what to do with their lives when high school is over and what kind of people they want to be. What was special about [season two] was that we got to dive into [the other characters] in a much deeper sense. I think we can do that again with the third season. There’s so much talent, you want to make sure everybody has the chance to have that.”</p><p>As to whether the third season will be its last, HBO and Max content chairman and CEO Casey Bloys wouldn’t confirm or deny. “Obviously the cast have all become stars, which you love to see—and Zendaya is obviously a big movie star,” Bloys told Variety after <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/emmys/>the Emmys</a>. “So, there is a practical reality to that. But it also depends on the stories Sam wants to tell. He’s in the thick of writing season three right now and we’ll leave it up to him and have those conversations about what he wants to do.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiikZi8o3nEpaarnJlivK950p6YrKeeYsGpvsSeZJ6toJ28s7XAaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-gould-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Gould Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-i-get-rid-of-muscovy-ducks-in-florida.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Do I Get Rid Of Muscovy Ducks In Florida</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
