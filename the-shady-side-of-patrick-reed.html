However, his parents, Bill and Jeannette Reed, as well as his younger sister, Hannah, have still been supportive of his career. In 2018, his parents showed&nbsp;<a href=#>GOLF</a> the sports memorabilia they had of him and the room they kept for him in their home. They've also tried to attend some of Reed's tournaments like the 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst, where they were escorted out by police. An official with USGA said it was <a href=#>Reed's wife Justine</a>'s&nbsp;"wishes" that they be removed.</p><p dir=ltr>It wasn't just Justine who didn't want them around, since Reed himself told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>&nbsp;that he wasn't happy that his dad and sister attended the Tour Championship. "I would have called for security to throw them out," he said. Additionally, when asked about not sharing his wins with his family, GOLF reported that he replied very coldly, saying, "I'm just out here to play golf and try to win golf tournaments."</p><p dir=ltr>Justine, however, is more direct in her disdain for Reed's family, writing on Facebook (via&nbsp;<a href=#>The Sun</a>), "His parents verbally and physically abused him for most of his life," and that, "They are sick people." Hannah denied those accusations in another social media post though, writing, "This is not a brother anymore, but a selfish, horrible stranger and it's heartbreaking."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know may be the victim of child abuse, please contact the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child (1-800-422-4453) or contact their <a href=#>live chat services</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlkaYJ5go6tn55lo52upcWMrKCdnV2ks268wK2popubYr%2BmscNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-officials-rave-about-bron-breakker-and-baron-corbin-s-chemistry-main-roster-move-in-sight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWE Officials Rave About Bron Breakker and Baron Corbins Chemistry, Main Roster Move In Sight</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./smart-cart-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Smart Cart Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-summer-2024-fashion-trends-that-lean-into-personal-style.html>8 Summer 2024 Fashion Trends That Lean into Personal Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bill-engvall-net-worth-2024.html>Bill Engvall Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chemist-warehouse-perfume-how-is-it-so-much-cheaper-than-myer.html>Chemist Warehouse perfume: how is it so much cheaper than Myer?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-a-2007-silverado-have-a-cabin-air-filter.html>Does a 2007 Silverado have a cabin air filter?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-think-about-him-every-day.html>I Think About Him Every Day</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR.
