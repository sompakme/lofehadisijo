The ending of Gina Yei season 1 can be explained as follows:</p><p>Gina received a phone call from her father, who said he wanted to meet her and tell her something important. Gina was shocked and confused, as she had never met her father before and had always resented him for leaving her and her mother.</p><p>Gina’s father also said he was sorry for what he did and that he loved her. Gina did not know how to react and hung up the phone. She then told her mother and her grandmother about the call, and they were also surprised and angry. They told Gina not to trust her father and not to meet him, as he was probably lying and had ulterior motives. Gina was torn between her curiosity and her loyalty to her family, and did not know what to do.</p><p>Jayden confessed his feelings for Gina and asked her to be his girlfriend. Gina was happy and flattered, as she had always liked Jayden and admired his talent and charisma. However, Gina was also hesitant, as she knew that Jayden had a complicated life and a lot of pressure from his father and his fans. Gina also felt guilty, as she knew that Manu liked her and that he was a better friend to her than Jayden. Gina did not give Jayden a clear answer and asked him for some time to think.</p><p>Manu realized that he was in love with Gina and decided to tell her how he felt. He wrote a song for her and planned to sing it to her at the IMC’s talent show. However, he was too late, as Jayden had already confessed to Gina and asked her to be his girlfriend. Manu was heartbroken and angry, as he felt that Jayden had betrayed him and that Gina had chosen the wrong guy. Manu decided to keep his feelings to himself and not to interfere with Gina and Jayden’s relationship, but he was secretly hoping that Gina would change her mind and choose him instead.</p><p>Vero was furious that Gina had won the IMC’s songwriting contest and that she had become popular and respected among the students and the teachers. Vero was also jealous that Gina had caught the attention of Jayden and Manu, two boys that she liked and wanted to date. Vero decided to take revenge on Gina and ruin her reputation and her career.</p><p>She teamed up with Mr. One, a shady music producer who wanted to exploit Gina’s talent and make money out of her. Vero and Mr. One plotted to sabotage Gina’s performance at the IMC’s music festival, which was a big opportunity for Gina to showcase her songs and to perform with a famous artist. Vero and Mr. One planned to steal Gina’s songs, to spread rumors about her, and to cause technical problems during her show.</p><p>Ruby was Gina’s best friend and roommate at the IMC. She was a cheerful and optimistic girl who loved dancing and fashion. She was also a loyal and supportive friend to Gina, Manu, and Jayden, and helped them with their problems and their projects. Ruby had a crush on Noah, a DJ and a music teacher at the IMC, who was also interested in her.</p><p>Ruby and Noah started dating and had a cute and fun relationship. Ruby also had a secret, which was that she was adopted and that she did not know her biological parents. Ruby wanted to find out more about her origins and her family, but she was afraid of hurting her adoptive parents and of losing her identity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gina-Yei-Season-2-spoiler.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ratings></span><strong>Ratings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gina Yei season 1 received positive ratings from critics and audiences, who praised its catchy songs, diverse cast, and uplifting message.
